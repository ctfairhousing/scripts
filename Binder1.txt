and currently paying $1,255. Mr. Freedman explained he did not receive a lease and he repeatedly asked and
never got a new one. He explained he did receive a copy, but it was not his signature and showed them
examples of his signature to show there’s a major difference between them. There were missing payments in his
transaction report showing payments and fees.
Mr. Freedman explained the conditions of his apartment, his A/C was not working and that he had congestive
heart failure. He purchased a $400 portable A/C unit because he could not stand the heat anymore. Mr.
Freedman stated that he came to an agreement with Broadmoor and the attorney he hired since that agreement
has disappeared. The agreement was that he would move by July 1, 2023, and Broadmoor would forgive all his
fees. He explained he had some serious health issues and was difficult for him to pack. His son was supposed to
move back to Connecticut to help but does not look like he will not come back until September. And his health
issues aren’t allowing him to pack. He explained his yearly income doesn’t leave him additional money for
security and has not been able to find a place to live that’s within his price range and is looking all over
Connecticut. He was denied help from Senior Services because he made $200 over the limit.
He filed maintenance reports that his bedroom ceiling was leaking and the last 2 months it’s been so bad he has
not been able to sleep in the room and sleeping in the living room. When he calls, they say they will address and
don’t completely. QVHD was called and came out, but he never heard back. He is now using the room to store
his hobby stuff, but unable to sleep in there due to the sound and smell. As of today his trash shoot does not
work without a repair date per the note on the shoot door.
Mr. Freedman explained he would be happy to make arrangements regarding his actual rent. He feels he’s been
paying more than he should and feels they owe him. And happy to move but needs time to. He has pictures of
the apartment conditions. His room leaks a day or two after it has rained and is afraid there is mold in his ceiling
and that will collapse on him. He is asking for help to have Broadmoor fix everything and give him some time
to move. He explains again the various health issues he is currently facing. Mr. Freedman shared pictures and
was shared with the commissioners. He was asked about his income. Salvatore explained that Mr. Freedman’s
attorney was notified via notices, emails and calls but has not responded. Salvatore stated that he has been
working with Mr. Freedman to locate a new apartment by making calls to apartments for rent, connecting him
and connecting him with other services.
Mr. Freedman was asked questions by the commission about his unit conditions and how much did Broadmoor
claimed he owed, and he stated $7,000.
Attorney Jeff Mastrianni was allowed to speak and was sent via email exhibits from the tenant. Attorney
Mastrianni explained that Mr. Freedman came to an agreement to move out due to unpaid charges. He asked
when did Mr. Freedman move in and how many work orders for repairs did he submit and/or have they been
resolved or addressed. He ask was Mr. Freedman aware of the settlement agreement that his attorney had
entered into on his behalf. He stated that there is no dispute in the amount of rent being paid and that there has
not been an increase in the rent. He that Mr. Freedman did not comply with the terms of the settlement
agreement. He explained also that Broadmoor is willing to address any concerns if a work order was submitted
and the proper approach calls are followed. And that this situation is not trying to increase the rent.
b. Case #22-029 Marcia Robinson: Ms. Robinson explained she has been paying her rent but the office is closed
on the weekends. She explained her unit conditions are unhealthy. She explained she pays her rent by check but
was late this month because she did not receive her compensation check and emailed that she was going to be
late. She stated that government people live in the building and don’t pay rent. She stated she does not work and
gets a monthly check. She stated that she has been to the doctors and there is nothing wrong with her brain. She
stated that there is something in her apartment that goes up into your body. She stated she was in her bedroom
and a monster was standing up against her wall and she told the office. And the monster is tall and cold. She
explained that the elevators don’t work at times. She explained she does not feel comfortable with workers
coming into her apartment. She stated that Simone had been quiet for the past few months and didn’t see her
anymore, but changes bodies and follows her around everywhere.
Commissioner Ned asked was there a work order placed for her mold concerns. She stated last year.
Commissioner Ned asked what is her initial complaint and she stated the raising of her rent. She showed
pictures of the mold from her bathroom ceiling. She stated it was a beautiful place but the monsters come up in
the world and she had to make sure she was not mutated. She stated she does not want to be evicted.

7. Cases to be heard:
a. Case #23-004 Aklilu Beyene: Mr. Beyene stated he had a written statement. My name is Aklilu Beyene and I
live at 640 Mix Avenue. On October 13, 2022, around 9am, my car was not where I left it. I called 911 to report
my car stolen but found out my car was towed. I contacted the management office to say that my car was legally
parked. I showed her who I contacted, and she said I couldn’t park there per their construction notice. I
explained it wasn’t clearly communicated where to park or where not to park in reading the notice. I did not
park in someone’s parking space. On November 4, 2023, I went to the management office to provide a copy of
the receipt of towing fees, and you must return my money.
She screamed at me and told me to get out of the office and called the police. A lot of people went to the office
to complain but were not discriminated against. I deducted the fees from my rent and was charged late fees for 6
months. I worked to build my credit score. Now I am not sure of the damage they have done to my score. On
January 1, 2023, I received a call from attorney Jeff Mastrianni, that he admitted that his client did wrong. They
are trying to pay me off and withdraw my case from this commission.
I will not allow them to use their power and resources to shut me up. It’s not about the money, I can afford it.
It’s about the sleepless nights that I didn’t have secure housing really protected by the law. It’s not about me
anymore, it’s about my neighbors. They cannot afford to live there anymore because those real estate companies
increase their rent by 28% a month. On January 20, 2023, I testified in front of the 100 legislative council. I
want my experience living at Broadmoor to conclude that this issue was complete. This has put me under great
stress and changed my quality of life.
Mr., Beyene was asked how much his charges were and stated $150 in late fees and $172 in towing.
Commissioner Cunningham asked how many months he was charged late fees and answered 6 months by Mr.
Beyene. Commissioner Cunningham stated that would be $900 plus the $172. Mr. Beyene was asked what kind
of construction notice he was given. Mr. Beyene stated it was left on his windshield and quoted it stated be
creative where to park. Commissioner Cunningham asked did he still lived at Broadmoor, and did he sign a new
lease, because the lease (exhibit) expired in March. Mr. Beyene stated he did not sign a new lease.
With no further questions Commissioner Robinson asked if the landlords council had any questions. Attorney
Chesson asked does the submitted document (exhibit) actually reflect any late fees that were charged and that
were paid because his copy seemed incomplete. Mr. Beyene pointed out the fees because he had a complete
copy of the exhibit.
(Everyone did not have all pages of the submitted document (exhibit). Mr. McClain left the meeting to
scan and forward the complete submitted document (exhibit). During this process Attorney Lee
requested from the chair to swear the 2-remaining witness under oath because he would have to leave
and log on to another meeting at 7pm. Commissioner Robinson granted his request. The exhibit was
scanned, passed out and/or emailed to all attendees.) Attorney Lee left the hearing.
Attorney Chesson questioned Mr. Beyene was his complaint about his rent going down because he was paying
$1,365 and it was reduced to $1,255.
Mr. Beyene asked, “went down”, Attorney Chesson stated yes, that’s what he is asking. Mr. Beyene stated that
was from when they first showed him the apartment on the 6th floor like the model and he put the money to hold
the apartment, then signed the lease and paid whatever amount they say it was at the beginning. Mr. Beyene
also stated that the apartment given not shown did not have a washing machine and dryer and that he paid for
this amenity and argued he did not want this apartment. He stated that they delayed the transition to the new
apartment like the one he was shown. He stated that other tenants said the apartments are not like the model.
Attorney Chesson asked so the landlords are not proposing a rent increase, right? Mr. Beyene stated they did,
and he did not sign the new lease, so they did not allow him to have a copy of it and then said they will not
renew his lease. Attorney Chesson stated that the letter in evidence says the rent was going up to $1,316, a $50
dollar increase. Attorney Chesson had no further questions.
Commissioner Robinson asked did the commission had any further questions for the witness and attorney
Chesson asked could ask one more, when was the parking notice? Ms. Bernstein said she could answer that and
stated it took effect on Friday October 5, 2022, and was placed on everyone windshield on October 4, 2022, and
if you did not use your car on the 4th, you may not have seen the notification because it was under the
windshield wipers, and she had a copy of the notice. She stated that the wording was unclear other than saying
not to park in another resident’s space and you must pass it down, but there is a line at the bottom of the notice
that says be creative and the descriptions of what spots are prohibited is very unclear. Ms. Bernstein stated the
actual construction started late August but did not close the parking spaces until October and the construction
took over 3 months to completed and stated that there were issues with the heat and hot water for several weeks
following. The commission asked did affect all the apartments and answered no just the buildings closest to the
construction, so their parking spots were not available. Ms. Bernstein stated the construction impacted buildings
with a list of maintenance issues.
The Commission asked what other things did not work and Ms. Bernstein answered the heat, hot water and they
were the main things but not always both at the same time. Sometimes it was one and not the other.
Commissioner Robinson asked Ms. Bernstein did she had anything else to say. Ms. Bernstein said yes that she
wanted to highlight the section of the Fair Rent Ordinance regarding retaliation and felt Mr. Beyene was being
retaliated against after his complaint was made and have continued to be charged late fees and should have
stopped when his complaint was made and the fact that it wasn’t is problematic, and that he was threated with
the police when going to the office to ask for assistance and as a resident for Broadmoor finds it disturbing and
whether or not there was a racial component involved she could not say but no one else had the cops called on
them regarding the towing of vehicles.
The Commission asked what Ms. Bernstein meant by retaliation against Mr. Beyene and stated by not renewing
his lease and read the section of the Fair Rent Ordinance regarding retaliation. Commissioner Robinson asked
based on your knowledge when was the refusal to renew the lease occur and Ms. Bernstein stated that it was to
her understanding that it was shortly after Mr. Beyene complaint was made to the Fair Rent Commission. Mr.
Beyene received a notice to quit in November and was given to him by the police and was told not to come to
the office and to call if he needed anything. He stated they did not answer the phone.
Attorney Chesson asked Ms. Bernstein was she in the meeting with Mr. Beyene and management the day when
the police were called, and she stated she was not but heard about it from Mr. Beyene and 2 other
representatives from the Tenants Union. Attorney Chesson asked if she had spoken to management or asked
why the police were called and she responded she did not. Attorney Chesson stated he had no further questions.
Commissioner Robinson asked Ms. Bernstein was anyone else towed due to construction and she stated many
people and herself twice. Commissioner Robinson asked what did be creative to her per the notice and she
stated she did not see it until she recovered her vehicle because she did not drive it daily and did not know her
vehicle was even towed until a bit later. Ms. Bernstein stated that their parking spots were not available, so
people invented spots at the end of rows if it didn’t block traffic, that was usually fine but not always and
parking at the leasing office happened frequently. The commission stated the bottom line there wasn’t a plan
for reassigning spots to those tenants that paid for a spot. The commission stated that there was not a massive
number of displaced tenant’s vehicles, but it was a significant number that there should have been a plan in
place.
Commissioner Robinson asked Ms. Bernstein what was the tenants office answer to why her car was towed and
she stated they answered it says it on the flyer or that you can’t park here, so we towed it. The Commission
determined the information on the parking notice due to construction was not clear. Ms. Bernstein stated that if
the staff was not working parking was safe but if they were in the office they went around checking and to make
sure tenants were not parked in areas according to their vague rules. The commission did not have any further
questions.
Commissioner Robinson asked attorney Chesson did he receive the sent parking notice and responded that he
did not as of yet but happy to argue their position without it. Commissioner Robinson said he was going to
email one more time. Commissioner Robinson asked Mr. Bernstein would he like to give a summary as to why
the commission should rule in his favor. Mr. Beyene stated leasing office breach his contract, he was
discriminated against, his car was towed due to unclear instructions, was removed from the leasing office by the
police, and that he pays his rent on time every month and they had put him under stress, possibly damaged his
credit score, thank you.
Attorney Chesson stated that the complaint with the Fair Rent Commission was filed in January 2023 about an
increase that began in March 2022 and was already being paid per the duration in accordance with the lease he
signed in February 2022. He stated that he doesn’t believe the Commission gets to go back 11 months for a
rental increase that was agreed to by the tenant. And the testimony seems to center around parking issues, and
that he did get the emailed copy and it specifically states which side of the buildings to park and where not to
park. He stated that parking does not fall under the Commission’s jurisdiction. He also stated that Ms. Bernstein
suggestion that the non-renewal predated Mr. Beyene’s complaint shows it can’t be retaliatory and as a matter
of fact and law, you can’t retaliate against somebody before they do something and that a tenant’s obligation to
pay does not stop when a complaint is made, and their failure is subject to late fees. Mr. Bernstein did not pay is
full amount and was subject to late fees pursuant to his lease and asked that Mr. Bernstein complaint be
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction to address his underlying concern for having to pay a tow company for
parking improperly, according to his notice.
Commissioner Robinson asked that council was not disputing the late fees for Mr. Beyene as a result of him
being in arrears for not paying the $172 he deducted for his rent regarding the towing fees. Attorney Chesson
stated he was not disputing the late fees and if his account did not have a 0 which it didn’t because of the $172
he was charged a late fee monthly per his lease. Mr. Beyene stated that there is a gap between when the rent is
due, and utilities and the utility bill arrives to a tenant’s mailbox separately which can carry over a balance after
the 10th which then will result in a late fee. No further questions and Commissioner Robinson called the next
witness.
b. Case #22-029 Abdul Kizawi: Ms. Bernstein asked if the commission had an interpreter for Mr. Kizawi.
Commissioner Robinson asked what type he needed, and Ms. Bernstein stated that an Arabic interpreter was
requested. Commissioner Robinson asked Mr. McClain was an Arabic interpreter available and Mr. McClain
stated no, and Mr. Kizawi agreed to still speak with Mr. McClain’s assistance because he was familiar with the
case. Commissioner Robinson asked Mr. Kizawi did he want to proceed in English without and interpreter. And
Mr. Kizawi responded yes.
Attorney Chesson aske may he say something before they got started and stated that Mr. Kizawi had been
working with a representative from the Kasia Phillips from the Tenant’s Union and management to resolve Mr.
Kizawi’s complaint and asked for a continuance on his case to get it resolved amongst the parties.
Commissioner Robinson asked Mr. Kizawi was he ok with continuing his case and Mr. Kizawi said yes but he
still wanted to speak.
Mr. Kizawi stated that he lived at Broadmoor for 5 years and pays on time and every year he gets a new lease,
and his rent has been increased the past 2 years. And this time it’s $240 more. He asked why so much and was
told everybody did. He stated to the commission to please help him, he’s an old man and can’t work more hours
and he’s 78 years old. He stated he looked for help and was finally given the number to the Fair Rent
Commission. He stated to the Commission the poor conditions of his apartment, the lack of parking, how his
heating bill was high due to no heat from time to time.
Commissioner Robinson asked what was Mr. Kizawi’s monthly income and he stated $1,800 to $2,000 a
month. Commissioner Robinson asked what his wife’s income was and he stated she works about 20-22 hours a
week and it varies, and she makes about $200-$250 a week. He stated that she had gone back prior to their
country for 4 months and he had to pay for everything alone. Commissioner Robinson asked was he bathroom
still leaking from a prior comment, and he stated it’s fixed now but still drips from time to time.
Commissioner Robinson asked did the other Commission members had any questions and the Commission
asked was there remaining damage in the apartment due to the leaking. Mr. Kizawi stated they fixed it and
painted over it. Attorney Chesson stated he did not have any questions but would ask the Commission to
consider the continuance request that was agreed by both parties. He stated that the Commission needed to
know that there’s a pending summary process case going on with the tenant as well and the parties tried to
resolve all issues. He asked the Commission not to exercise any jurisdiction in this issue and give the parties the
opportunity to resolve and that request was made by Kasia Phillips.
The Commission granted a postponement of the case, to include an interpreter and give the parties a chance to
resolve. Mr. Kizawi agreed. The Commission motioned to continue this case on August 24, 2023.

7. Cases to be heard:
a. Case #22-030 Denise Sherrod: Not present. Multiple attempts were made via mail and phone calls.
Commission dismissed case.
b. Case #22-039 Kadija Nicholson: Commission Robinson swore in tenant and representative from the tenant’s
union. Attorney McEleney objected to Paul B. giving an opening statement and is not an attorney but an
advocate. Commissioner Robinson stated the commission noted his objection and continued. Representative
Paul B. gave a quick chronology of events leading to the filed complaint. The tenant was not allowed to move in
as scheduled due to the missing carpet and had to extend her rental truck. The tenant submitted a maintenance
order regarding mold on the ceiling. Maintenance came days before Christmas to tear her place apart and the
tenant stated they could not due to the holiday, her kids and guests coming.
The maintenance order was for mold in the children’s bedroom ceiling. Per management the cause was due to a
bad gutter that was leaking into the roof and coming through the ceiling. The tenant did not feel comfortable
signing a renewal agreement due to the conditions of the unit and the rental increase. The increase was from
$1,400 to $1,700 and still had mold all over the kid’s bedroom. Paul B. stated one of the children had bad
asthma and used a nebulizer all the time and had not been sleeping in the bedroom due to the mold.
Paul B. stated there were several other unit issues from a loose toilet, broken blinds, kitchen cabinets falling
apart, peeling paint, and a missing smoke detector that had been missing for 4 years. The tenant attempted to
schedule repairs, maintenance came, looked at the ceiling, left and did not come back for an extended period
like they were supposed to. The tenant also had taken the day off for repairs that were not addressed. The tenant
had taken off other days for repairs, submitted additional maintenance orders because the repair men did not
return to finish the job. The ceiling was cut open, leaving dust and debris all over and the children had been
sleeping on the couch. The workers had to cut more of the ceiling, saying it was worse than they thought. Time
had passed and the tenant continued attempts to have the ceiling fixed. The workers eventually returned,
installed sheet rock, but left the ceiling unfinished, unpainted, and the room covered in dust, mold, and debris.
During this long process there was not complete access to the room the tenant was paying for. The tenant
contacted the property manager Shannon McMahon because the room was inhabitable, scheduled repairs to be
completed again, took time off from work again and the ceiling is still unfinished.
The tenant’s car was towed June 2022 because the office refused to give her a parking permit because she was
late on her rent and the tenant is currently waiting on United CT funds. The office knows this. This happened
before the new strict parking rules were set in place. The vehicle was also damaged when towed by the towing
company My Hoop. The towing company is 20 miles from the residence and the tenant had to pay for the miles
and was charged for 30 miles. They charged the tenant $380 when should have been $360 and refused to return
the overcharged fees. Paul B. closed his opening statement.
Attorney McEleney was allowed to make his opening statement and stated that he really had to hear actual
testimony and stated that all these issues and statements were before his clients had purchased the property.
The tenant spoke and stated that she understood they were new owners but that did not dissolve their
responsibility for the conditions of the property they purchased. She wanted to show the conditions before and
currently to showcase what life had been living there and they did agree to fix the unit and failed to do so as did
the prior owners. The tenant had lived there for almost 5 years with her 2 children, and they attend Hamden
public schools. She stated moving would not be easy, unsettling for her children to change schools.
The tenant stated she was an educator for Hamden public schools. The tenant stated the initial rental agreement
was for $1,350 but when she came to view, they increased by $50 because it included a stackable washer/dryer
raising the rental price to $1,400. The tenant was issued a new lease recently that increased the rent by $300.
The tenant stated her monthly income, and she was a contractual employee and only got paid 10 months out of
the year. The tenant stated she had missed rental payments this summer and again was working with United CT
for assistance and owes around $3,000 in rental fees. The tenant stated she had been making partial payments
during this time. The tenant also stated she currently does not have a signed lease.
Paul B. asked did the tenant reached out to the property manager to compensate for the series of issues and the
inability to use one of the bedrooms and the tenant stated she emailed Shannon, and the response was that there
was no compensation being offered. The tenant stated that she reviewed her lease and noticed she had been
charged higher and incorrect late fees per the lease. She was being charged $100 when the fees were $70 or $75.
The tenant claimed it was not adjusted. The tenant stated that one of her children had a respiratory illness and
the conditions of the unit were unsafe. The tenant stated the outside conditions of the property were unsafe and
the worst of the other buildings. The tenant stated monies lost due to taking time off work, products to clean the
mold and carpet issues. The tenant stated she did minor repairs herself and that she sticks to herself.
Commission Robinson allowed cross examination.
Attorney McEleney asked the tenant the timeframe when she moved in, and that the majority of the issues were
before the new owners took ownership of the property. The tenant confirmed and stated still the current issues
and the mold concerns that had been also had been reported to QVHD. She stated also the issues with the
bathroom and everything that had not been addressed under the new owners. The tenant stated the property
managers did a walk through, issued a new lease and was going to be charged for repairs of things prior that
attempts being made to fix. The tenant also stated she did not receive results of QVHD clearing the unit from
any mold issues. The tenant stated she also did not receive child support.
The tenant submitted photos (exhibits) and was dispersed by Salvatore McClain via email. Commissioner
Robinson asked how long the bedroom was not in use and the tenant stated about 5 months. Commissioner
Robinson asked was she given an explanation why she wasn’t given a towing pass. The tenant stated a lady
named Giselle stated they were not given passes to tenants behind on rent. The tenant stated that under the new
owners parking was no longer assigned and created a worse parking situation.
The property manager Shannon McMunn was allowed to speak and stated that they took steps to repair the unit
and had trouble coordinating times with the tenant but admitted the current repairs did need to be sanded and
painted but claimed that aesthetic not water damage as claimed. Shannon claimed to have an email from QVHD
confirming the safety of the unit. Attorney McEleney shared the results on the screen. Shannon McMunn claims
that attempts to repairs were made but the tenant did not answer the door and then stated they never came.
The tenant noted that the property manager Shannon McMunn was not sworn in and the commission apologized
and did so. Commissioner Robinson stated that her testimony had to be stricken. Attorney McEleney and Ms.
McMunn stated that it did not need to be stricken and reaffirmed that her prior statements were true and stood
by them. Commission Robinson asked Ms. McMunn were the prior repairs and conditions of the property were
the responsibility of the current owners and she claimed it was. Paul B. asked were the contractors hired for
repairs professionals and Ms. McMunn claimed yes but they learn skills also on the job. All parties revisited the
parking rules.
Summations were given and went over all prior statements from both parties. Ms. Nicholson was removed for
the next case to be heard.
c. Case #23-001 Rachael Rochester: Not present. Multiple attempts were made via mail and phone calls.
Commission will give one more chance before dismissing the case. A letter will be sent.
d. Case #23-003 Kiana Gurley: The tenant requested a continuance due to losing her representative. The tenant
stated her current complaint now was regarding her security deposit not given because she has now since
moved. Attorney McEleney did not oppose a continuance.
e. Case #23-007 Curtis Clarke: Not present. Salvatore McClain stated that the tenant was a truck driver and on
the road a lot and attending was difficult per the tenant. The commission motioned one more attempt to be
made, a letter to be sent before dismissing the case.
8. Review Submissions and take Action:
Case #22-039 Kadija Nicholson: Rent will be prorated in the amount of $840 for 5 months and rent will
be paid in escrow. Repairs need to be made to unit and the case will remain open until repairs are

Salvatore McClain connected with an Arabic interpreter through Language Line Solutions as requested from
Mr. Kizawi and the commission. Mr. Kizawi expressed his concerns about his yearly rental increases and stated

Mr. Kizawi stated he needed help. Mr. Kizawi stated but he pays his rent every month.

case. Commissioner Robinson asked Mr. McClain can the commission include Mr. Kizawi at the next hearing
on September 7, 2023, and would it allow for proper notice to Broadmoor Apts. Mr. McClain stated that Mr.
Kizawi case could be included, and notification will go out immediately allow the proper notice time.
Mr. McClain asked Mr. Kizawi was he okay if his case was continued on September 7, 2023, and the case
would finally be settled. Mr. Kizawi stated again his stress from his yearly increases and his neighbors don’t
seem to get increases. Mr. Kizawi stated that he was a good man, doesn’t bother anyone, he just works and

b. Case #22-042 Ariel-Raven Estes: Commissioner Cummingham stated that this case was not heard prior per
the request of the landlord’s attorney claiming both parties are in the process of resolving. The commission
established that this was both parties’ second request for a continuance and they had to decide to accept their
request due to the new ruling allowing each party one request to continue and a second request to be decided by
the commission. The commission agreed that attorney Mastrianni was present at the initial scheduling of the
case and was aware of the day it was to be heard.
Mr. McClain stated that he called Ms. Estes, and she was at work unable to attend the hearing and that her
representative from the Tenants Union moved and she did not have any further contact. He stated that Ms. Estes
claimed that the Tenants Union representative was in talks with Broadmoor Apts to come to an agreement and
settle the case, but she was unaware of the actual terms.
Due to technical difficulties the connection was lost from the hybrid meeting, but the zoom portion was
still active. Commission Robinson, Attorney Lee and Director Bivens spoke via zoom.
Commissioner Robinson stated that everybody was frozen, and Attorney Lee agreed. Attorney Lee stated that
Director Bivens was the host now instead of Salvatore and maybe everyone needed to re-log in. Director
Bivens asked Commissioner Robinson and Attorney Lee could they hear her, and they both stated yes. Director
Bivens stated that Salvatore had made her co-host and there were some connection issues in the building and
Salvatore was working to reconnect.
Attorney Lee asked Director Biven how the cases were closed out settled between the tenant/owner. Did they
file a withdrawal of their housing complaint with the Fair Rent Commission and how was it documented.
Director Bivens stated that both parties had to send in writing that the complaint has been resolved. Attorney
Lee spoke about how to properly close out a case with the commission. Attorney Lee suggested in the
settlement agreement it should state that the tenant agrees to withdraw the appeal based on the settlement.
Director Bivens agreed going forward the settlement agreement should say the plaintiff or tenant withdraws
their appeal. Director Bivens stated that it looked like Salvatore tried to reconnect but was kicked off. Director
Bivens stated she was going to contact Salvatore and see what’s going on.
The hybrid portion of the meeting was able to reconnect, and the meeting continued.
Commissioner Robinson asked Mr. McClain to resume from where he left off regarding case #22-042 Ariel-
Raven Estes. Mr. McClain stated that Ms. Estes was not present and felt uncomfortable and unprepared for
tonight's hearing without her union representative. Mr. McClain stated he told Ms. Estes to forward all
correspondence and paperwork she had from Broadmoor Apts. attorney and her union representative. He will
then go through everything and resume mediation between both parties. The commission agreed this was Ms.

d. Case #22-036 Arsene Lwamba: Case settled between both parties and closed.
e. Case #23-016 Joseph Batts: Mr. McClain stated that both parties have settled and had drawn up a new lease.
Mr. Batts met with Mr. McClain earlier today and reviewed the new lease. Due to a date discrepancy, Mr.
McClain instructed Mr. Batts to contact the owner and have it corrected before signing.
Commission Robinson asked Attorney Lee how the commission should handle this case. Attorney Lee stated to
the commissioners not present during the technical issues that Salvatore had done a great job getting a couple fo
these cases settled and was going to speak to Salvatore and Director Bivens to include in further settlement
agreements to include a provision stating the tenant agrees to withdraw the appeal. The tenant can do it in
writing or email to withdraw and this will remove the case off of the commission’s agenda.
f. Case #23-023 James D’Andrea: Mr. McClain stated that his complaint was regarding he lives in subsidized
housing, he suffered a loss in income, he did not receive his annual redetermination, but the owners increased
his rent by $25 dollars. Mr. McClain stated that he sent notices and made several calls to the owners Geller
Commons and had no response from them. Mr. McClain stated he called Mr. D’Andrea earlier today as a
reminder for tonight's hearing and did not get a response. Mr. McClain stated he contacted the tenant’s sister,
but she did not hear from Mr. D’Andrea also. Mr. McClain stated to the tenant’s sister he did not get a response
from Geller Commons, and she said she would look for an alternate number she had for them and would give it
to him tomorrow.
Mr. McClain stated that at the request from the tenant and sister, he contacts and updates them both. The sister
is like a caregiver or oversees the tenant’s affairs. Mr. McClain stated that the tenant or owner was not present
at tonight's meeting. The commission decided to reschedule this case for a later date.
The commission motioned and agreed for a special meeting on September 21, 2023, at 6pm to hear additional
cases. This case will be via zoom due to the unavailability of the conference room.

2. Attendance: Mr. Robinson called attendance.
3. Public Comment:
Aklilu Beyene was allowed to speak. Mr. Beyene stated, good evening, ladies and gentlemen, my name is Aklilu Beyene
and I live in Broadmoor Apartments. The address is 640 Mix Avenue, apartment A. I had a fair rent, hearing on July 20,
2023, with the Fair Rent Commission. By majority they ruled in my favor. For reimbursement of towing fees, and late fee
charges in the form of appropriated rent for the next 12 months and to reduce the range to 1230.
For 12 months, however, the Broadmoor apartment willfully disobeyed the Fair Rent Commissions order. The Leasing
Office tried to convince me to renew my lease, but she failed. I did not sign it. The lease was to start on March 1, 2023.
My argument was this is not the date the Commission decided was the effective date for my new lease and because of that
I did not sign.
They tried to increase the rent to $1,369 and if I don’t sign it now it will be increased by another $145 per month. So, I'm
requesting the Fair Rent Commission to enforce the order given by the power of the Fair Rent Ordinance. So, you must
act so the people who live in this town will not get hurt again by this greedy leasing office. That's my comment. Thank
you very much for giving me the chance to speak.
Paul Boudreau was allowed to speak. Good evening. My name is Paul Boudreau. I live on K. View, and I'm the lead
organizer for the Hamden Tenant Union. Having to do this is like a recurring nightmare at this point. I feel as some of you
don't think this is important like it's a hobby like scrapbooking. With a nice merlot or something. Every one of these cases
belongs to a human being. People with family kids, hardships and everybody's just sticking their head in the sand and
pretending Hamden's great. And it's not great.
Our apartments are leaking, smelling, burning, and full of mold. We are under constant threat of eviction towing, and
every form of intimidation and retaliation you could think of. We've been physically attacked had our vehicles taken been
hit by tow trucks. Yes, that's plural. We get threats of violence via text and voicemail fake sheriffs fake marshals, and
visibly armed men showing up at doors to serve notices most of which are just and out of intimidation.
The management spread lies about Union members, puts us in harm's way. This week we needed a parking pass from the
leasing office. They literally cracked the door open, threw it on the ground, and closed the door like we were dogs. That's
how they treat us. One member had a fake sheriff come to the door. It was just some woman came to her door and said she
was the sheriff serving a notice to quit.
When the woman pressed her, she said, well, I'm not a sheriff, I'm a marshal. Then she admitted. She was just a tenant
from across the street. The landlord had sent to serve her. She left crying. For some reason the woman who had been
served was trying to console her.
An hour later a large man comes to her door, carrying a pistol on his on his hip to serve a second notice quit for no reason
and when she asked him if he was a sheriff or a marshal, he said No, and just walked away. The first person didn't
intimidate. So, they sent somebody bigger and armed. So, when are we going to take this seriously, after one of us is shot
or run over?
It's not just me, it's far from just me. And it's not even just our Union members. It's everybody at Seramonte and
Broadmoor, and all the other complexes in hand, and owned by these slumlords, who put profit over people every day,
thousands of Hamden citizens. And still. when the landlord ignores the Fair Rent Commissions orders and retaliates,
evicts, intimidates. Nothing is done. Nothing.
We've been talking about it for months, and it's for real. They're showing up at people's doors with cops. The Health
Department, trying to intimidate them and forcing their way into their apartments literally for no reason, because they
complained about something legitimate.
And what we get is. We’ll give them a call and tell them to stop. Which sounds a lot like thoughts and prayers to me. It
has about the same effect, too. Nothing is done. We need you to do your job, at this point, it almost seems criminal. Last
night and all day yesterday several of us were checking the website for the agenda to be posted because we wanted to
make sure we were prepared for the cases coming up. It wasn't posted. We checked well into the evening about
7,8,9,0'clock. 3 of us were checking at different computers in different locations. So, it wasn't like a clear, your cache
kind of thing. There was no agenda there this morning. I get up, and there's one there that's predated the six. So, somebody
forgot and then posted this agenda and somehow backdated it. This seems criminal, literally criminal.
And, that means this hearing is not valid. Anything decided here is going to be appealed because you didn't follow the
rules of procedure. Simple procedure. Post the thing 24 hours ahead, at least it should be longer. We're expected to
prepare these cases and represent people 3, 3 to 6 at a time, sometimes as volunteers, not lawyers, as we've heard over and
over and we're expected to do this in 24 hours sometimes with no notice of exactly who's going to be up and what we're
looking at. We still haven't gotten the discovery from the last hearing.
The landlord presents evidence and spreadsheets and all this stuff all the time, and we ask for it every time. We haven't
gotten anything, not a thing. Everybody needs to follow the rules. They make us follow the rules. And we end up on the
street. They filed 6 evictions. Yesterday. The ones I could find on Broadmoor filed a lot more yesterday. These people are
evicting. They're about to create a really huge housing crisis. And we're going to have to take care of all these people.
We're going to have to provide services. Hamden's going to be paying the state of Connecticut's going to be paying, you
know, who's not paying the landlords.
They're taking their money. They're going to Jersey, and they're laughing at us. They treat us like animals. They think
we're all lower people and they think they're getting by on us. They come to our cities, they wreck the places, they let
them go and turn them into slums, and then they leave, lowering everybody's property values for homeowners, too. And
we just let them. When are we going to enforce the rules? When are people going to be safe here in Hamden?
Why do people like with the just follow the rules and just making a phone call is not doing it. Where's you know? Where's
our escrow account? We're supposed to be putting the last person's money into an escrow. It's not happening because we
don't have an account. We've been talking about this. I think, since January, it's insane. And I really feel like it's criminal.
We are going to go to the Attorney General with this and finally, Mayor Garrett, Sean Grace and the rest of the cousins,
neighbors, and uncles that seemed to be running the appointed parts of this government. We see you. We see what you're
doing, and you need to stop. You want to get elected. You need to stop and start working with the 9,000 renters in
Hamden because we vote, too. Have a great night. Thank you.
Commissioner Robinson thanked Mr. Boudreau and opened the floor for Rafael and Tyrone.
Rafael & Tyrone said hello and stated they had spoken with Paul on a few occasions regarding a few things. We've been
here for 2 years. They have done nothing to address the work orders that we've done put in as far as the mildew goes in
the basement. They've just sent like people out just to kind of look at things. They say it's fixed. It’s never fixed. They
come back out. It's the same situation. More recently in May our neighbors had a fire, and their place was no longer
habitable, and we had smoke and water damage in our unit, and the Red Cross came out and put us in a hotel for 2 nights.
The management office didn't know what was going on. They didn't know that they had to put us in a hotel. Since then,
it's just been a run around. We feel that has been retaliation, because after the fire they sent us a letter to quit last week or
a week ago, 2 weeks ago, and in retaliation for us, filing a complaint of them. Still not doing anything with them. So that's
what we want to say we put it also complaint with the Quinnipiac Valley Health Department. That was put in there was
supposed to send out a fire Marshal was supposed to come out. That was never done is just like nobody has done
anything. Thank you.
Commissioner Robinson, thank them. Commissioner Cunningham ask have you submitted a formal complaint to the Fair
Rent Commission as well. Rafael & Tyrone stated they did. Commissioner Robinson asked if there were any more
comments from the public. Commissioner Robinson stated he had a question for Attorney Lee.
Commissioner Robinson stated that the commission ordered in a previous hearing for a tenants rent to be paid into an
escrow account. Does the Town have an escrow account open now. Attorney Lee stated that he is aware of.
Commissioner Robinson asked if there is anything that the commission can do to help speed up the process. Attorney Lee
stated that he did not know. When the Fair Rent Commission got reconstituted 6 to 9 months ago, they tried to set up an
escrow account for the Fair Rent Commission, and there was some reason why it was not established. It is one of the
powers of the Fair Rent Commission to make people pay rent to escrow, so make sense to have an escrow account.
Commissioner Robinson stated we're going to have to follow up on that, because we ordered that the rent would be paid in
escrow in a previous case that was heard at the not that last meeting the meeting before last. And for the order to be
implemented, we must have it paid in that we have to have an escrow account opened so that must happen.
Attorney Lee stated the fact of the matter is that the Commission has right to order rent to be paid into escrow underneath
the ordinance. So, you should have an account. I think it's really a function of trying to deal with the finance office and
establishing the account. Commissioner Robinson asked, did any of the other commissioners have any comments on that?
Commissioner Cunningham stated I do find it distressing and frustrating that orders of the Commission are not being
adhered to by landlords or enforced by the town. We hear cases become decisions. And just. Speaking personally, I just
kind of trust that they will be enforced. And if they're not, that's a problem. It's not something I intend to take slightly, and
I certainly don't take these cases lightly.
This is not a hobby or something. I take it as something flammable. I just like to assure the public that.
Commissioner Robinson stated I don't think any of us do. It's definitely not a hobby. It's something that we're dedicated to
because we actually live in this town. We're concerned about it. And some of us are renters, too. So, I don't think anyone
here is doing it as a hobby. I understand Mr. Boudreau is angry, but it's definitely not a hobby. There are easier hobbies.
We're all concerned about what's going on here.
Commissioner Robinson stated the orders need to be followed. Attorney Lee, can we have cases brought up where we find
that the orders are not being followed?
Attorney Lee stated I mean this quite frankly. This is the first time I've heard that orders are not being followed, so I think
what must happen is, whoever was involved in the case must communicate to Salvatore or somebody in the office, that the
orders are not being complied with. And if that gets communicated to the town, and the town is aware of it. Then the
Commission does have certain powers under the ordinance of enforcement, and I think it's 33, dash 86 deals with
enforcement of orders of the Commission, and the Commission does have the right to go to court to enforce its orders or
refer it to housing prosecutor for enforcement of the orders. So, there is a mechanism under the ordinance for enforcement
of the orders.
Commissioner Robinson asked will we need additional testimony from the particular tenant or complainants? Attorney
Lee stated no, I think they can file a complaint, saying that the order has not been complied with. I think that town can
then do whatever investigation that they deem appropriate. If the Commission, then wants to authorize the office of the
town attorney to commence legal action. The Commission can do that. If the Commission wants to refer the matter to the
housing prosecutor, then the Commission could do that. So, I guess to create we should create a process. So, if somebody,
if a tenant or landlord feels like the order's not being complied with. They should make a complaint to Salvatore.
Then that matter should be just at a meeting, and the Commission should decide what enforcement action, if any, they
want to take. Commissioner Robinson stated so how about we send formal correspondence to all the tenants, and landlord
in the previous cases and that they indicate to the Commission whether the order is being followed. If we get feedback
that the order is not being followed by particular tenants, then we could take action ourselves under the town ordinance.
Attorney Lee stated we can do that if we want. I will also add because I know there was a
the statement that the town or the commission was not enforcing the regulations. As I said, if we're not aware of the
violation of the of the orders. We can't. But the town is currently advertising for an Assistant town attorney position to
deal solely with the Fair Rent Commission and to deal with the appeals and to deal with any enforcement action so and is
dedicating its resources to support the Commission and to support the decisions of the Commission, whether they be in
favor of the landlord or then tenant, that is in the works.
Commission Robinson stated what about the tenants? If they want the order enforced? And it's not, it's not being followed.
Attorney Lee state, what I mean they would have to indicate they were not followed. They would have to let the town
know that the order of the Fair Rent commission was not being enforced and we would have to communicate it, or put on
an agenda for the Commission, and then the Commission can make a determination as to what enforcement action, if any,
it wants to take. And I'm looking at the ordinance now, there's section 33.8 6 deals with enforcement and 3 options. The
tenants need to know that it's not being enforced to let us know.
Commissioner Robinson stated we need to send some type of correspondence for our past cases indicating the order's not
being followed that they indicate to the Commission.
Commission Robinson asked the Commission how does everyone feels about that? Commission Coggins stated I agree.
And I wonder if we might also be able to in future orders going forward, leave the cases open until for a certain period of
time, or until a certain resolution and include in the order language. Addressing both the issue of retaliation which is
brought up in the public comment, and what constitutes retaliation and the consequences for that and also indicates, you
know not only that the complainant, can reach out to the Commission to let us know that the order is not being followed
but also establish a procedure for ongoing check-in, and include in the order a consequences for the order not being
followed to make it very clear
Attorney Lee stated I think it's a good suggestion. I would not recommend keeping the cases open. I think the Commission
should close the case, you know, make their decision close the cases, because then the parties can take whatever action
they deem appropriate after that. But I think we definitely should advise parties that if an order is not enforced that they
have the right to come back to the enforcement or report that to the town. I assume Salvadore can advise the Commission
action they want to take agree that the parties should be advised that there is a mechanism for enforcement powers.
Commissioner Coggins stated and just to clarify that would mean that they don't have to file a separate complaint when
they’re coming back to the Commission? Attorney Lee said correct. I think they would not have to file a separate
complaint. They would have to notify the town that the order was not being complied with, but it would be attached to the
previous case. Attorney Lee stated that was correct.
Commissioner Cunningham stated I think we have one more public comment. I see a Khadija raising their hand, I believe
that was another prior case of ours. And then with regards to the agenda not being posted until this morning. Obviously, it
should have been posted as soon as possible, and I extend the commission’s regret for that fact that it wasn't posted until
this morning. But is it the case that I know that we have to send notice within 7 days?
Attorney Lee stated you have to post notice of the agenda on the time website 24 hours prior to the meeting. I don't know
if that happened, or if it didn't happen, I was going to add. The claim is that it did not. Yes, right. And I was going to ask
Salvatore or Karen, who? Who would have been the people posting it? That was true or not but if it, if it is accurate, then
the Commission should not take up any of the hearing items tonight.
Commission Robinson asked was the agenda posted before 6pm or in the morning. Salvatore stated it was posted late. I
take full responsibility for it being late. Commissioner Robinson stated I understand it being posted late, but the parties
did have notice of it. I get the agendas needs to be posted but the parties were aware that they had cases. Attorney Lee
stated that it's frustrating, but we can't go forward with the hearings and as somebody already mentioned. They're going to
appeal. Everything's going to be appealed, and it's going to be appealed because there wasn't adequate notice in the fact
that who's the parties to the cases had notice does not mean that anybody who wanted to participate in those cases.
Commissioner Robinson stated so you're saying that the parties didn't have adequate notice is that what you're saying.
Attorney Lee stated they may have had adequate notice because they may have received notice a week in advance of the
hearing, but anybody else who wants to participate in the hearings may not have had adequate notice and violation of the
freedom of Information Act.
Commissioner Robinson said and that's grounds for appeal? Attorney Lee said yes.
Commissioner Bradford stated that if we go through with the hearings based on what the ruling is or the policy is that we
cannot go on with the hearings because they didn't have 24 hour notice. Commissioner Robinson stated that is right, so
we can't even bring anything to a vote as far as approving the minutes or anything like that today. Attorney Lee stated
technically, that is right.
Commissioner Cunningham stated I do think we still have some additional public comment. If they have a right to be
heard. Commissioner Robinson stated okay, Khadija and we can have her brought up.
Kadija Nicholson stated I am here tonight on this meeting because my case was seen by the fair rent commission, I wanna
say, last month and I wasn't able to ask questions the night that you guys deliberated about the case. I heard you guys
saying stuff about the orders not being complied with, which is something that I'm currently experiencing right now. I did
send out an email. I don't know how things are going, cause I kind of joined the zoom a little late. I know that the landlord
was supposed to like schedule certain things. I put in tickets for the repairs that you guys sent the order to, and they're
closing. They close the tickets. I also know, like you guys said something about an escrow account for me to pay my rent
into, but to my understanding, the escrow account isn't set up as yet, and I just don't know if it sets a certain precedence
when or if I continue to pay my rent to Seramonte. I just had a few questions about how things are going. If it's not in
compliance. If these things aren't being complied to, and what should I do as a tenant if I'm experiencing these things.
Commissioner Robinson stated that Ms. Nicholson needs you to send notice they're not complying. Ms. Nicholson stated
but, like I said, my biggest thing right now is they were supposed to set up or arrange a date with me prior to me, returning
back to work. That was never done. And like I said, I don't really feel comfortable setting anything up via phone with
them, because then they lie about it. I'd rather have a paper trail, and that's what the tenant portal is for. The tenant portal
is for me to put in a ticket. You see that this maintenance is stick. This maintenance ticket is in, and you, you know, you
reach out to me to schedule an appointment, whether it's due to portal or whatever they. I open the ticket. They know that
this is a whole new ticket, so I put in this ticket 3 times for the issue in my kids’ room, and they are aware, because we
also have this meeting. With this hearing, with the fair rent permission. They are aware that these things are undone in the
apartment and they're closing the tickets. So, what am I supposed to do? Am I supposed to call them now and be like,
Hey, I put in a ticket on June twenty-first. You close the ticket.
And you know that we're having a hearing for this with the Fair Rent Commission. But you're closing the ticket, and it
reflects on the tenant portal, so I don't know what to do in that, you know, instance. And then, like, I said with, they're still
charging me full rent, even with the order, saying that I'm supposed to be charged a different amount. They're still
charging me full rent. I don't know any information about the escrow account because I know that I'm in the audit says to
pay it to escrow account, but the escrow account isn't set up, so will I ever pay it into this escrow, because I don't know,
and I'm still living here with the conditions that I was living with prior to the order coming into play. So, I'm just
confused.
Ms. Nicholson stated she emailed Salvatore specifically. I do know that Salvatore is very busy. I know he has many
different things that he is tending to but that's who I emailed.
Commissioner Robinson stated you've given notice to the town. We're definitely going to follow up on this on the escort
account because that is something that has to be. It's been ordered by the Commission, and it has to be opened and paid
into, and it should have happened, it should happen it should have happened already.
Ms. Nicholson stated I sent Salvatore an email in regard to my concerns, and I also sent him screenshots of Seramonte
closing out the tickets that I'm putting in regards to the issue in my kid’s room. My kids still aren't utilizing their bedroom
to this day. So, I'm still living with the same conditions. It's just like terrible. And like, I said, if when I put something in
through the tenant portal. They're not following up with it, and then they come on here and they don't tell the truth about
what's really happening. I don't like, I said, I don't feel comfortable doing anything over the phone with them. If you need
to set up an appointment email, me put it in writing. Put it in the center tenant portal. So that's just the route that I want to
go. But if I'm putting in tickets and you're closing the tickets, knowing that the job is not done is like, what am I supposed
to do as a tenant like? I shouldn't have to go through a hassle when you know that this was something put into place to
order for you to follow, and you're not following it. You close the ticket.
Commissioner Robinson stated because this meeting is not supposed to be happening. We can't vote on anything right
now. So what I'm going to do is we're going to add it to the agenda of the next meeting, not for the case to be heard, but to
find out the status as far as the formal contact that you made with the town.
Ms. Nicholson stated she had one more question. I heard someone say something about like closing the cases after they
have heard. So how would that go? For, like, you see, like my case was heard, for example. But now I have this issue
where they're not in compliance. How would closing it after they're heard, be beneficial to the tenants or the orders being
put into place.
Commissioner Robinson stated I'll say this, and this is just my comment on it. Don't think of it as the case actually being
closed as being closed completely. It's close for evidentiary purposes as far as presenting the case. But the enforcement
element of the case is not closed. Ms. Nicholson asked so the enforcement part is not closed. Commission Bradford stated
you did the right thing by notifying Salvatore. So now we have something in writing saying that you know this hasn't
taken place, now we can follow up on it.
Commissioner Robinson said we have Ms. Greta Blau with her hand up, and please have her brought up.
Hi, it! It's Paul again, actually, we also have to get these technical problems looped out. I got blocked. After the testimony
I couldn't get back in. I had to use Greta's phone to get in and about 10 other people texting me saying they can't get into
the meeting. Like it's been a year, and we still can't have a meeting without a bunch of technical difficulties, not even like
a little glitch, I mean, like a bunch of big technical difficulties.
Commissioner Robinson stated we have to adjourn this meeting. Commissioner Cunningham stated we need to move to
reschedule these missed cases. Salvatore stated we're not going to be able to do the 28. It's not going to give enough time
to get the notices out. The only opportunity is for the fifth. Commission Cunningham stated that would be the date of our
regular hearing. So, it's 2 weeks from today, though and 3 weeks from today, though. Salvatore stated yes, but because
this isn't a meeting, you would have to schedule them on the twenty first, and from the twenty first to the 28. It's not
enough time.
Commissioner Robinson stated he understood, and we’ll have to schedule them on the twenty first to hear on the fifth.
Commissioner Bradford asked if we had any case for the fifth and Salvatore said nothing scheduled as of yet.
Commissioner Robinson stated my apologies to everyone. Who attended. Today we'll try to iron out the issues. We'll
definitely have the agenda posted. I just wanna apologize. I know everyone's time is valuable. We had a lot of cases that
we had to hear today. So, my apologies, everyone, I am going to motion to have this hearing adjourned.
Commissioner Bradford seconded the motion. Commissioner Robinson all in favor. Aye, aye. Okay. The next hearing will
be on the twenty first at 6pm.
Thank you.

Agenda
Approval of September 7,2022 Minutes
Mr. Cunningham made a motion to approve the minutes from the meeting held on
September 7, 2022. Ms. Bradford seconded the motion. All were in favor and the
motion passed unanimously.
Public Comment
Mr. Lee stated that he has a preliminary order to be discussed prior to the hearings.
Mr. Lee stated that Mr. Kirt Westfall, representing attorney for Serramonte Estates,
has asked for an extension in order to prepare for the hearings to be discussed on
September 15, 2022. In consideration to continue this hearing to a later date
Seramonte Estates would forgo any rent increases until the Fair Rent Commission is
able to hold the stated hearings. Under the above circumstances Mr. Lee believes
this to be a fair request by Mr. Westfall and Seramonte Estates and he suggested
that the commission grant the request as presented.
Mr. Lee stated that the town is in compliance under the ordinance regarding notice
provided.
Mr. Cunningham asked Mr. Lee to clarify the point regarding forgoing payment of
rent increases. Mr. Lee clarified that pursuant to Ordinance Section 33.80 if a
tenant has an appeal pending they are obligated to pay the last agreed upon rent
until the Fair Rent Commission makes a determination. Mr. Cunningham stated he
did not see the benefit to granting the continuation. Mr. Lee clarified that there is a
benefit as if there is a continuation to October Seramonte will not charge the
increase on that month.
The commission opened up the discussion to the public. After hearing discussion
from the public and the tenants who were to present their cases, Mr. Robinson
called for a motion to hear the statements from the tenants this evening and then
have a continuation in two weeks time, on September 29, 2022 at 6pm to hear from
Attorney Westfall regarding his client, Seramonte Estates. Mr. Cunningham
seconded the motion. All were in favor and the motion for continuation passed
unanimously.
New Business
Case #22-001
Mr. Conte opened the hearing of Case #22-001. Mr. Lee swore in Mr. Sameed Iqbal
of 661 Mix Avenue apartments B11 and B12 who is representing the case on behalf
of himself, Mr. Nadeem F. Iqbal, Ms. Naila Nadeem, Mr. Ahmed Iqbal, and Mr.
Hayam Jared. Mr. S. Iqbal spoke regarding the notice of his rent increase. This is not
the first time that the rent has been increased, and there have been no updates to
their home. Commission members asked questions regarding employment and
income status of tenants in this home. The tenant did not attempt to negotiate with
the landlord as they feared retaliation.
Mr. Lee swore in Ms. Greta Blau of 63B Kaye Vue Drive to testify on behalf of the
above tenants. Ms. Blau read a statement on behalf of all Seramonte tenants who
have cases against the Seramonte estates. Her statement went on to address
multiple issues on these properties and their violations regarding Connecticut
statutes regarding health and safety.
Mr. Robinson asked if Ms. Blau knew of anyone else who had such a high rent
increase like the above tenants. She stated that she did not know anyone else with
that high of an increase. Ms. Bradford clarified that the rent increase of $1,500 was
actually for two different units. Mr. Iqbal clarified that the wall had been taken
down between the two units so it acts as one large unit as there is one kitchen.
Ms. Bradford made a motion to continue this hearing on September 29, 2022 at
6pm. Mr. Cunningham seconded the motion. The motion passed unanimously.
Case #22-002
Mr. Lee left the meeting at 6:30pm.
Mr. Conte opened up the hearing of Case #22-002. Mr. Cunningham swore in Ms.
Yamil Crevecoeur of 418 Mix Avenue. Mr. Cunningham swore in Mr. Luke
Melonakaos-Harrison who would be speaking on behalf of Ms. Crevecoeur. Mr.
Melonakaos-Harrison explained Ms. Crevecoeur’s background, and income status.
He explained that she was forced to miss work at certain times due to conditions of
the ground during winter storms. He explained the lack of parking and lights on the
grounds. He explained that if this rent increase goes through then she and her
family will be displaced and they have nowhere else to go. There has been no
adjustment to the grounds or her apartment to show the reason for the rent
increase. When she spoke to the landlord they offered her a $400 rent increase
instead of the first request of $800 which Mr. Melonakaos-Harrison believes
demonstrates that the $800 was arbitrary and the lower offer was made to push
Ms. Crevecoeur to drop her complaint with the Fair Rent Commission. Mr.
Melonakaos-Harrison also echoes Ms. Blau’s words that she made in her statement
while representing the tenants in case #22-001.
Mr. Cunningham asked clarifying questions regarding the number of bedrooms and
tenants at this property.
Ms. Blau asked if there is a decision made on September 29, 2022 when the
continuation is scheduled, will tenants need to pay their rent increase beginning in
October of 2022. Ms. Bradford clarified that they may not come to a decision on
September 29, 2022 and if they go into October, which she thinks they are likely to
do, then there would be no rent increase for October of 2022.
Mr. Robinson made a motion to continue this hearing on September 29, 2022 at
6pm. Mr. Cunningham seconded the motion. The motion passed unanimously.
Case #22-003
Ms. Georgia Green of 109 Kaye Vue Drive Apartment 2-C stated that she needed to
leave the meeting due to an emergency. She left the meeting at 6:12pm.
Mr. Robinson made a motion to continue this hearing on September 29, 2022 at
6pm. Ms. Bradford seconded the motion. The motion passed unanimously.
Case #22-004
Mr. Conte opened up the hearing of Case #22-004. Mr. Cunningham swore in Ms.
Yeliza Crespo of 95 Kaye Vue Drive #1B. Ms. Crespo explained that she has lived at
her residence since 2016. She commented that there have been zero renovations
done to the apartments. She stated that there has been damage to her car due to
the very deep potholes in the parking lot. The laundry room is inadequate and the
premises are embarrassing. In regards to the snowstorms, she has missed work
due to being able to leave the grounds as there was no snow removal. She clarified
that not only were the parking lots not plowed, but there was no snow removal
done on the sidewalks and stairs. Ms. Crespo lives in the building where there were
two fires within a short amount of time. She stated that the fire alarm did not go off
during this fire. In addition, after the fire, the soot and other damage to the walls in
the hallways was not cleaned. The roof was damaged and completely open from
the fire and they did not fix it so there was rain coming into the building. Her door
that was broken down during the fire was never repaired. She also has concerns
about the safety of the grounds, especially with having to park far away due to
there being no assigned parking spots. When asking for raises in the past, they
verbally stated they needed to raise the rent in order to build a gym and improve
her apartment. She has had to call to ask them to remove stoves and toilets left in
the hallway and on the grounds.
Mr. Robinson made a motion to continue this hearing on September 29, 2022 at
6pm. Ms. Bradford seconded the motion. The motion passed unanimously.

the complaints currently on file with the Fair Rent Commission. With the four from
this evening, there are twelve additional complaints filed.
Mr. Cunningham made a motion to hold hearings for cases 005, 006, 007, 008, 009,

Thursday, September 7, 2023, at 6:00 pm
This meeting was via zoom.
Members Present: Conte Robinson (Chair), Peter Cunningham (Vice Chair), Sharon Bradford, Jennifer Coggins
and Antwan Ned.
Others Present: Timothy Lee (Asst. Town Attorney), Salvatore McClain (Fair Rent Commission Asst.), Karen
Bivens (Director of Arts, Culture, Recreation & Wellness and Abdul Kizawi (Tenant).
1. Call to Order: Mr. Robinson called the meeting to order at 6:14.
2. Attendance: Mr. Robinson called attendance.
3. Public Comment:
Aklilu Beyene was allowed to speak. Mr. Beyene stated, good evening, ladies and gentlemen, my name is Aklilu Beyene
and I live in Broadmoor Apartments. The address is 640 Mix Avenue, apartment A. I had a fair rent, hearing on July 20,
2023, with the Fair Rent Commission. By majority they ruled in my favor. For reimbursement of towing fees, and late fee
charges in the form of appropriated rent for the next 12 months and to reduce the range to 1230.
For 12 months, however, the Broadmoor apartment willfully disobeyed the Fair Rent Commissions order. The Leasing
Office tried to convince me to renew my lease, but she failed. I did not sign it. The lease was to start on March 1, 2023.
My argument was this is not the date the Commission decided was the effective date for my new lease and because of that
I did not sign.
They tried to increase the rent to $1,369 and if I don’t sign it now it will be increased by another $145 per month. So, I'm
requesting the Fair Rent Commission to enforce the order given by the power of the Fair Rent Ordinance. So, you must
act so the people who live in this town will not get hurt again by this greedy leasing office. That's my comment. Thank
you very much for giving me the chance to speak.
Paul Boudreau was allowed to speak. Good evening. My name is Paul Boudreau. I live on K. View, and I'm the lead
organizer for the Hamden Tenant Union. Having to do this is like a recurring nightmare at this point. I feel as some of you
don't think this is important like it's a hobby like scrapbooking. With a nice merlot or something. Every one of these cases
belongs to a human being. People with family kids, hardships and everybody's just sticking their head in the sand and
pretending Hamden's great. And it's not great.
Our apartments are leaking, smelling, burning, and full of mold. We are under constant threat of eviction towing, and
every form of intimidation and retaliation you could think of. We've been physically attacked had our vehicles taken been
hit by tow trucks. Yes, that's plural. We get threats of violence via text and voicemail fake sheriffs fake marshals, and
visibly armed men showing up at doors to serve notices most of which are just and out of intimidation.
The management spread lies about Union members, puts us in harm's way. This week we needed a parking pass from the
leasing office. They literally cracked the door open, threw it on the ground, and closed the door like we were dogs. That's
how they treat us. One member had a fake sheriff come to the door. It was just some woman came to her door and said she
was the sheriff serving a notice to quit.
When the woman pressed her, she said, well, I'm not a sheriff, I'm a marshal. Then she admitted. She was just a tenant
from across the street. The landlord had sent to serve her. She left crying. For some reason the woman who had been
served was trying to console her.
An hour later a large man comes to her door, carrying a pistol on his on his hip to serve a second notice quit for no reason
and when she asked him if he was a sheriff or a marshal, he said No, and just walked away. The first person didn't
intimidate. So, they sent somebody bigger and armed. So, when are we going to take this seriously, after one of us is shot
or run over?
It's not just me, it's far from just me. And it's not even just our Union members. It's everybody at Seramonte and
Broadmoor, and all the other complexes in hand, and owned by these slumlords, who put profit over people every day,
thousands of Hamden citizens. And still. when the landlord ignores the Fair Rent Commissions orders and retaliates,
evicts, intimidates. Nothing is done. Nothing.
We've been talking about it for months, and it's for real. They're showing up at people's doors with cops. The Health
Department, trying to intimidate them and forcing their way into their apartments literally for no reason, because they
complained about something legitimate.
And what we get is. We’ll give them a call and tell them to stop. Which sounds a lot like thoughts and prayers to me. It
has about the same effect, too. Nothing is done. We need you to do your job, at this point, it almost seems criminal. Last
night and all day yesterday several of us were checking the website for the agenda to be posted because we wanted to
make sure we were prepared for the cases coming up. It wasn't posted. We checked well into the evening about
7,8,9,0'clock. 3 of us were checking at different computers in different locations. So, it wasn't like a clear, your cache
kind of thing. There was no agenda there this morning. I get up, and there's one there that's predated the six. So, somebody
forgot and then posted this agenda and somehow backdated it. This seems criminal, literally criminal.
And, that means this hearing is not valid. Anything decided here is going to be appealed because you didn't follow the
rules of procedure. Simple procedure. Post the thing 24 hours ahead, at least it should be longer. We're expected to
prepare these cases and represent people 3, 3 to 6 at a time, sometimes as volunteers, not lawyers, as we've heard over and
over and we're expected to do this in 24 hours sometimes with no notice of exactly who's going to be up and what we're
looking at. We still haven't gotten the discovery from the last hearing.
The landlord presents evidence and spreadsheets and all this stuff all the time, and we ask for it every time. We haven't
gotten anything, not a thing. Everybody needs to follow the rules. They make us follow the rules. And we end up on the
street. They filed 6 evictions. Yesterday. The ones I could find on Broadmoor filed a lot more yesterday. These people are
evicting. They're about to create a really huge housing crisis. And we're going to have to take care of all these people.
We're going to have to provide services. Hamden's going to be paying the state of Connecticut's going to be paying, you
know, who's not paying the landlords.
They're taking their money. They're going to Jersey, and they're laughing at us. They treat us like animals. They think
we're all lower people and they think they're getting by on us. They come to our cities, they wreck the places, they let
them go and turn them into slums, and then they leave, lowering everybody's property values for homeowners, too. And
we just let them. When are we going to enforce the rules? When are people going to be safe here in Hamden?
Why do people like with the just follow the rules and just making a phone call is not doing it. Where's you know? Where's
our escrow account? We're supposed to be putting the last person's money into an escrow. It's not happening because we
don't have an account. We've been talking about this. I think, since January, it's insane. And I really feel like it's criminal.
We are going to go to the Attorney General with this and finally, Mayor Garrett, Sean Grace and the rest of the cousins,
neighbors, and uncles that seemed to be running the appointed parts of this government. We see you. We see what you're
doing, and you need to stop. You want to get elected. You need to stop and start working with the 9,000 renters in
Hamden because we vote, too. Have a great night. Thank you.
Commissioner Robinson thanked Mr. Boudreau and opened the floor for Rafael and Tyrone.
Rafael & Tyrone said hello and stated they had spoken with Paul on a few occasions regarding a few things. We've been
here for 2 years. They have done nothing to address the work orders that we've done put in as far as the mildew goes in
the basement. They've just sent like people out just to kind of look at things. They say it's fixed. It’s never fixed. They
come back out. It's the same situation. More recently in May our neighbors had a fire, and their place was no longer
habitable, and we had smoke and water damage in our unit, and the Red Cross came out and put us in a hotel for 2 nights.
The management office didn't know what was going on. They didn't know that they had to put us in a hotel. Since then,
it's just been a run around. We feel that has been retaliation, because after the fire they sent us a letter to quit last week or
a week ago, 2 weeks ago, and in retaliation for us, filing a complaint of them. Still not doing anything with them. So that's
what we want to say we put it also complaint with the Quinnipiac Valley Health Department. That was put in there was
supposed to send out a fire Marshal was supposed to come out. That was never done is just like nobody has done
anything. Thank you.
Commissioner Robinson, thank them. Commissioner Cunningham ask have you submitted a formal complaint to the Fair
Rent Commission as well. Rafael & Tyrone stated they did. Commissioner Robinson asked if there were any more
comments from the public. Commissioner Robinson stated he had a question for Attorney Lee.
Commissioner Robinson stated that the commission ordered in a previous hearing for a tenants rent to be paid into an
escrow account. Does the Town have an escrow account open now. Attorney Lee stated that he is aware of.
Commissioner Robinson asked if there is anything that the commission can do to help speed up the process. Attorney Lee
stated that he did not know. When the Fair Rent Commission got reconstituted 6 to 9 months ago, they tried to set up an
escrow account for the Fair Rent Commission, and there was some reason why it was not established. It is one of the
powers of the Fair Rent Commission to make people pay rent to escrow, so make sense to have an escrow account.
Commissioner Robinson stated we're going to have to follow up on that, because we ordered that the rent would be paid in
escrow in a previous case that was heard at the not that last meeting the meeting before last. And for the order to be
implemented, we must have it paid in that we have to have an escrow account opened so that must happen.
Attorney Lee stated the fact of the matter is that the Commission has right to order rent to be paid into escrow underneath
the ordinance. So, you should have an account. I think it's really a function of trying to deal with the finance office and
establishing the account. Commissioner Robinson asked, did any of the other commissioners have any comments on that?
Commissioner Cunningham stated I do find it distressing and frustrating that orders of the Commission are not being
adhered to by landlords or enforced by the town. We hear cases become decisions. And just. Speaking personally, I just
kind of trust that they will be enforced. And if they're not, that's a problem. It's not something I intend to take slightly, and
I certainly don't take these cases lightly.
This is not a hobby or something. I take it as something flammable. I just like to assure the public that.
Commissioner Robinson stated I don't think any of us do. It's definitely not a hobby. It's something that we're dedicated to
because we actually live in this town. We're concerned about it. And some of us are renters, too. So, I don't think anyone
here is doing it as a hobby. I understand Mr. Boudreau is angry, but it's definitely not a hobby. There are easier hobbies.
We're all concerned about what's going on here.
Commissioner Robinson stated the orders need to be followed. Attorney Lee, can we have cases brought up where we find
that the orders are not being followed?
Attorney Lee stated I mean this quite frankly. This is the first time I've heard that orders are not being followed, so I think
what must happen is, whoever was involved in the case must communicate to Salvatore or somebody in the office, that the
orders are not being complied with. And if that gets communicated to the town, and the town is aware of it. Then the
Commission does have certain powers under the ordinance of enforcement, and I think it's 33, dash 86 deals with
enforcement of orders of the Commission, and the Commission does have the right to go to court to enforce its orders or
refer it to housing prosecutor for enforcement of the orders. So, there is a mechanism under the ordinance for enforcement
of the orders.
Commissioner Robinson asked will we need additional testimony from the particular tenant or complainants? Attorney
Lee stated no, I think they can file a complaint, saying that the order has not been complied with. I think that town can
then do whatever investigation that they deem appropriate. If the Commission, then wants to authorize the office of the
town attorney to commence legal action. The Commission can do that. If the Commission wants to refer the matter to the
housing prosecutor, then the Commission could do that. So, I guess to create we should create a process. So, if somebody,
if a tenant or landlord feels like the order's not being complied with. They should make a complaint to Salvatore.
Then that matter should be just at a meeting, and the Commission should decide what enforcement action, if any, they
want to take. Commissioner Robinson stated so how about we send formal correspondence to all the tenants, and landlord
in the previous cases and that they indicate to the Commission whether the order is being followed. If we get feedback
that the order is not being followed by particular tenants, then we could take action ourselves under the town ordinance.
Attorney Lee stated we can do that if we want. I will also add because I know there was a
the statement that the town or the commission was not enforcing the regulations. As I said, if we're not aware of the
violation of the of the orders. We can't. But the town is currently advertising for an Assistant town attorney position to
deal solely with the Fair Rent Commission and to deal with the appeals and to deal with any enforcement action so and is
dedicating its resources to support the Commission and to support the decisions of the Commission, whether they be in
favor of the landlord or then tenant, that is in the works.
Commission Robinson stated what about the tenants? If they want the order enforced? And it's not, it's not being followed.
Attorney Lee state, what I mean they would have to indicate they were not followed. They would have to let the town
know that the order of the Fair Rent commission was not being enforced and we would have to communicate it, or put on
an agenda for the Commission, and then the Commission can make a determination as to what enforcement action, if any,
it wants to take. And I'm looking at the ordinance now, there's section 33.8 6 deals with enforcement and 3 options. The
tenants need to know that it's not being enforced to let us know.
Commissioner Robinson stated we need to send some type of correspondence for our past cases indicating the order's not
being followed that they indicate to the Commission.
Commission Robinson asked the Commission how does everyone feels about that? Commission Coggins stated I agree.
And I wonder if we might also be able to in future orders going forward, leave the cases open until for a certain period of
time, or until a certain resolution and include in the order language. Addressing both the issue of retaliation which is
brought up in the public comment, and what constitutes retaliation and the consequences for that and also indicates, you
know not only that the complainant, can reach out to the Commission to let us know that the order is not being followed
but also establish a procedure for ongoing check-in, and include in the order a consequences for the order not being
followed to make it very clear
Attorney Lee stated I think it's a good suggestion. I would not recommend keeping the cases open. I think the Commission
should close the case, you know, make their decision close the cases, because then the parties can take whatever action
they deem appropriate after that. But I think we definitely should advise parties that if an order is not enforced that they
have the right to come back to the enforcement or report that to the town. I assume Salvadore can advise the Commission
action they want to take agree that the parties should be advised that there is a mechanism for enforcement powers.
Commissioner Coggins stated and just to clarify that would mean that they don't have to file a separate complaint when
they’re coming back to the Commission? Attorney Lee said correct. I think they would not have to file a separate
complaint. They would have to notify the town that the order was not being complied with, but it would be attached to the
previous case. Attorney Lee stated that was correct.
Commissioner Cunningham stated I think we have one more public comment. I see a Khadija raising their hand, I believe
that was another prior case of ours. And then with regards to the agenda not being posted until this morning. Obviously, it
should have been posted as soon as possible, and I extend the commission’s regret for that fact that it wasn't posted until
this morning. But is it the case that I know that we have to send notice within 7 days?
Attorney Lee stated you have to post notice of the agenda on the time website 24 hours prior to the meeting. I don't know
if that happened, or if it didn't happen, I was going to add. The claim is that it did not. Yes, right. And I was going to ask
Salvatore or Karen, who? Who would have been the people posting it? That was true or not but if it, if it is accurate, then
the Commission should not take up any of the hearing items tonight.
Commission Robinson asked was the agenda posted before 6pm or in the morning. Salvatore stated it was posted late. I
take full responsibility for it being late. Commissioner Robinson stated I understand it being posted late, but the parties
did have notice of it. I get the agendas needs to be posted but the parties were aware that they had cases. Attorney Lee
stated that it's frustrating, but we can't go forward with the hearings and as somebody already mentioned. They're going to
appeal. Everything's going to be appealed, and it's going to be appealed because there wasn't adequate notice in the fact
that who's the parties to the cases had notice does not mean that anybody who wanted to participate in those cases.
Commissioner Robinson stated so you're saying that the parties didn't have adequate notice is that what you're saying.
Attorney Lee stated they may have had adequate notice because they may have received notice a week in advance of the
hearing, but anybody else who wants to participate in the hearings may not have had adequate notice and violation of the
freedom of Information Act.
Commissioner Robinson said and that's grounds for appeal? Attorney Lee said yes.
Commissioner Bradford stated that if we go through with the hearings based on what the ruling is or the policy is that we
cannot go on with the hearings because they didn't have 24 hour notice. Commissioner Robinson stated that is right, so
we can't even bring anything to a vote as far as approving the minutes or anything like that today. Attorney Lee stated
technically, that is right.
Commissioner Cunningham stated I do think we still have some additional public comment. If they have a right to be
heard. Commissioner Robinson stated okay, Khadija and we can have her brought up.
Kadija Nicholson stated I am here tonight on this meeting because my case was seen by the fair rent commission, I wanna
say, last month and I wasn't able to ask questions the night that you guys deliberated about the case. I heard you guys
saying stuff about the orders not being complied with, which is something that I'm currently experiencing right now. I did
send out an email. I don't know how things are going, cause I kind of joined the zoom a little late. I know that the landlord
was supposed to like schedule certain things. I put in tickets for the repairs that you guys sent the order to, and they're
closing. They close the tickets. I also know, like you guys said something about an escrow account for me to pay my rent
into, but to my understanding, the escrow account isn't set up as yet, and I just don't know if it sets a certain precedence
when or if I continue to pay my rent to Seramonte. I just had a few questions about how things are going. If it's not in
compliance. If these things aren't being complied to, and what should I do as a tenant if I'm experiencing these things.
Commissioner Robinson stated that Ms. Nicholson needs you to send notice they're not complying. Ms. Nicholson stated
but, like I said, my biggest thing right now is they were supposed to set up or arrange a date with me prior to me, returning
back to work. That was never done. And like I said, I don't really feel comfortable setting anything up via phone with
them, because then they lie about it. I'd rather have a paper trail, and that's what the tenant portal is for. The tenant portal
is for me to put in a ticket. You see that this maintenance is stick. This maintenance ticket is in, and you, you know, you
reach out to me to schedule an appointment, whether it's due to portal or whatever they. I open the ticket. They know that
this is a whole new ticket, so I put in this ticket 3 times for the issue in my kids’ room, and they are aware, because we
also have this meeting. With this hearing, with the fair rent permission. They are aware that these things are undone in the
apartment and they're closing the tickets. So, what am I supposed to do? Am I supposed to call them now and be like,
Hey, I put in a ticket on June twenty-first. You close the ticket.
And you know that we're having a hearing for this with the Fair Rent Commission. But you're closing the ticket, and it
reflects on the tenant portal, so I don't know what to do in that, you know, instance. And then, like, I said with, they're still
charging me full rent, even with the order, saying that I'm supposed to be charged a different amount. They're still
charging me full rent. I don't know any information about the escrow account because I know that I'm in the audit says to
pay it to escrow account, but the escrow account isn't set up, so will I ever pay it into this escrow, because I don't know,
and I'm still living here with the conditions that I was living with prior to the order coming into play. So, I'm just
confused.
Ms. Nicholson stated she emailed Salvatore specifically. I do know that Salvatore is very busy. I know he has many
different things that he is tending to but that's who I emailed.
Commissioner Robinson stated you've given notice to the town. We're definitely going to follow up on this on the escort
account because that is something that has to be. It's been ordered by the Commission, and it has to be opened and paid
into, and it should have happened, it should happen it should have happened already.
Ms. Nicholson stated I sent Salvatore an email in regard to my concerns, and I also sent him screenshots of Seramonte
closing out the tickets that I'm putting in regards to the issue in my kid’s room. My kids still aren't utilizing their bedroom
to this day. So, I'm still living with the same conditions. It's just like terrible. And like, I said, if when I put something in
through the tenant portal. They're not following up with it, and then they come on here and they don't tell the truth about
what's really happening. I don't like, I said, I don't feel comfortable doing anything over the phone with them. If you need
to set up an appointment email, me put it in writing. Put it in the center tenant portal. So that's just the route that I want to
go. But if I'm putting in tickets and you're closing the tickets, knowing that the job is not done is like, what am I supposed
to do as a tenant like? I shouldn't have to go through a hassle when you know that this was something put into place to
order for you to follow, and you're not following it. You close the ticket.
Commissioner Robinson stated because this meeting is not supposed to be happening. We can't vote on anything right
now. So what I'm going to do is we're going to add it to the agenda of the next meeting, not for the case to be heard, but to
find out the status as far as the formal contact that you made with the town.
Ms. Nicholson stated she had one more question. I heard someone say something about like closing the cases after they
have heard. So how would that go? For, like, you see, like my case was heard, for example. But now I have this issue
where they're not in compliance. How would closing it after they're heard, be beneficial to the tenants or the orders being
put into place.
Commissioner Robinson stated I'll say this, and this is just my comment on it. Don't think of it as the case actually being
closed as being closed completely. It's close for evidentiary purposes as far as presenting the case. But the enforcement
element of the case is not closed. Ms. Nicholson asked so the enforcement part is not closed. Commission Bradford stated
you did the right thing by notifying Salvatore. So now we have something in writing saying that you know this hasn't
taken place, now we can follow up on it.
Commissioner Robinson said we have Ms. Greta Blau with her hand up, and please have her brought up.
Hi, it! It's Paul again, actually, we also have to get these technical problems looped out. I got blocked. After the testimony
I couldn't get back in. I had to use Greta's phone to get in and about 10 other people texting me saying they can't get into
the meeting. Like it's been a year, and we still can't have a meeting without a bunch of technical difficulties, not even like
a little glitch, I mean, like a bunch of big technical difficulties.
Commissioner Robinson stated we have to adjourn this meeting. Commissioner Cunningham stated we need to move to
reschedule these missed cases. Salvatore stated we're not going to be able to do the 28. It's not going to give enough time
to get the notices out. The only opportunity is for the fifth. Commission Cunningham stated that would be the date of our
regular hearing. So, it's 2 weeks from today, though and 3 weeks from today, though. Salvatore stated yes, but because
this isn't a meeting, you would have to schedule them on the twenty first, and from the twenty first to the 28. It's not
enough time.
Commissioner Robinson stated he understood, and we’ll have to schedule them on the twenty first to hear on the fifth.
Commissioner Bradford asked if we had any case for the fifth and Salvatore said nothing scheduled as of yet.
Commissioner Robinson stated my apologies to everyone. Who attended. Today we'll try to iron out the issues. We'll
definitely have the agenda posted. I just wanna apologize. I know everyone's time is valuable. We had a lot of cases that
we had to hear today. So, my apologies, everyone, I am going to motion to have this hearing adjourned.
Commissioner Bradford seconded the motion. Commissioner Robinson all in favor. Aye, aye. Okay. The next hearing
will be on the twenty first at 6pm.
Thank you.

Agenda
Approval of September 15,2022 Minutes
Mr. Cunningham made a motion to approve the minutes from the meeting held on
September 15, 2022. Ms. Bradford seconded the motion. All were in favor and the
motion passed unanimously.
Public Comment
Mr. Cunningham spoke to the many questions coming through the Q&A. He
clarified that these cases are continuations from the meeting on September 15,
2022. At that meeting, the tenants were able to give their side of the cases
presented. The hearing was continued to September 29, 2022 in order for the
counsel for the Seramonte Estates to give their testimony and cross examine those
who presented their cases. The union representatives were not permitted to speak
as they had already presented their cases, which they agreed to do, on September
15, 2022. He went on to explain that the hearing has been moved to a webinar
format so that there is more formality in the hearings.
Correspondence
Mr. Robinson stated that the commission received a letter from the attorney
representing the Seramonte Estates. The letter stated that there will be new
counsel representing the Seramone Estates. The letter was a request for copies of
the complaints from the tenants and a request for a continuation for the hearings
that are scheduled for October 6, 2022 as he will be out of state.
Continuation of Hearings
Case #22-001
Mr. Conte continued the hearing of Case #22-001. Mr. Lee explained that as this is a
continuation Mr. Sameed Iqbal did not need to be sworn in again as he continues to
be under oath. Mr. Iqbal of 661 Mix Avenue apartments B11 and B12 is
representing the case on behalf of himself, Mr. Nadeem F. Iqbal, Ms. Naila Nadeem,
Mr. Ahmed Iqbal, and Mr. Hayam Jared. Mr. McEleney explained that a lot of
evidence presented regarding the general buildings will overlap for all four cases
represented this evening. Mr. McEleney went forward with his cross examination of
Mr. Iqbal. Mr. McEleney asked Mr. Iqbal questions regarding the nature of the unit
and the families that live at this unit. Mr. McEleney shared his screen to show the
tenant agreement which states that heat and hot water is included with the rent.
Mr. Iqbal argued that he has found units that are two bedroom units which are
much lower rent than what he is being asked to pay. It was confirmed by Mr. Iqbal
that the washer and dryer in their unit has now been fixed and is in working order
after not working for six to seven days.
Mr. McEleney called Shannon McMunn as his witness. Mr. Lee swore in Ms.
McMunn. Mr. McEleney confirmed that Ms. McMunn is employed with Seramonte
Estates management company and has worked for Northpoint Management for
almost three years and has worked at the Seramonte property since January of
2021. Ms. McMunn took time to explain the many changes and updates to the
Seramonte properties since January of 2021. Mr. McEleney showed Exhibit 2 which
is an overhead view of different Seramonte units. Ms. McMunn stated she has
never been inside Mr. Iqbal’s unit. She stated that it is the only unit that exists that
was once two, two bedroom units and has now been updated to be a one, five
bedroom unit with one kitchen. She stated that she believes that there are also two
separate electric meters for this unit. She is not aware of any current issues inside
these units. When she looked into the work order history everything that had been
requested was completed. Mr. McEleney showed Exhibit 3 which is an example of a
spreadsheet which Northpoint Management uses for work orders for the units. The
spreadsheet showed closed tickets from March of 2021 through mid September
2022. She again stated that there are no open tickets for Mr. Iqbal’s units and there
are no housing code violations open as far as she knows at this time for Mr. Iqbal’s
units. Mr. McEleney showed Exhibit 4 which went over comparable complexes to
Mr. Iqbal’s. Mr. McEleney asked Ms. McMunn to explain her findings.
Mr. Lee explained that Mr. Iqbal and all of the other tenants needed to have the
opportunity to cross examine Ms. McMunn.
Ms. Greta Blau was permitted to enter the webinar and cross examine Ms.
McMunn. Ms. Blau used this time to ask for a continuance and ask that the tenant’s
rent be put into an escrow account until the hearings are continued and concluded.
After more clarification from the Mr. Robinson regarding the running of the
meeting, Ms. Blau decided to move forward with cross examining Ms. McMunn. Ms.
Blau asked Ms. Munn if the properties are comparable and how much would be
added to monthly rent with amenities she had listed. Ms. McMunn stated she can
not make that distinction as she is not an owner of the property. Ms. Blau asked
Ms. McMunn to clarify comments she had made to a tenant regarding building a
gym. Ms. McMunn clarified that she had stated that a gym was a possibility but did
not recall saying that it was why rents were being raised. She asked if Ms. McMunn
asked maintenance to enter tenants units to look for “evictable offenses” to which
Ms. McMunn answered “no.”
Ms. Blau asked for a continuance as she stated that the meeting was not being run
correctly.The commission members explained multiple times that this was a
continuance of the previous meeting held on September 15, 2022 at which the
tenants gave their testimony. They also explained again that the webinar format
was to run the meeting in a more professional manner. Ms. Blau continued to ask
for a continuance. Mr. Cunningham asked Ms. Blau to explain why she wanted a
continuance. She stated, “we need to talk to some people. This is not how it is
supposed to run.” Mr. Cunningham tried to explain again that with moving to first a
Zoom format and then a webinar format the commission is doing their best to
create a well-run meeting. Ms. Blau continued to state that it was not a fair hearing
and that she wanted a continuance and wanted everyone’s rent to go into escrow.
Ms. Blau explained that they want a continuance in order to find out how the
meetings are supposed to be run.
After much deliberation Mr. Robinson made a motion to have a continuance of the
hearings for cases #22-001. Ms. Bradford seconded the motion and the motion
passed.
There was deliberation regarding the tenant’s rents going into escrow. It was
explained again that the tenants need to pay the last known rent until these cases
have been decided upon by the commission.
After much deliberation Mr. Robinson called for a motion to have a continuance of
the hearings for cases #22-001, #22-002, #22-003 and #22-004 on October 19 at
6pm. Ms. Bradford made the motion and it was seconded by Mr. Cunningham. The
motion passed.
Other Business
The members of the commission discussed future dates to hear the remainder of
the complaints currently on file with the Fair Rent Commission. Notification will be
sent from the town regarding the cases moved to October 19 and October 27. Mr.
Robinson made a motion to accept moving the hearings that were scheduled for
October 6 to October 27 at 6pm. Ms. Bradford seconded the motion and it passed.
Tentative future dates for future hearings are November 3, 2022 and November 10,
2022.
Adjournment
The business concluded at 7:58pm to be continued as stated above on October 19,
2022.

Mr. Kizawi. An interpreter was called and joined the hearing. Attorney Burns stated he was a lawyer with New
Haven Legal Assistance Association and was representing Mr. Kizawi. Attorney Burns stated that his client
alleges his rental charges are excessive and wanted a determination that Broadmoor retaliated against Mr.
Kizawi following the complaint with the FRC. Attorney Burns requested orders to cease and desist, a reduction
of rent and removal of late fees. Attorney Burns stated that Broadmoor was charging Mr. Kizawi $150 in late
fees for not paying the $240 increase in rent.
Attorney Burns stated that Mr. Kizawi paid his rent on time per Broadmoor’s ledger and was elderly and being
now targeted with an eviction for a total of fees not based off his monthly rent that was being paid. He stated
Broadmoor was violating Fair Rent rules and would like the Commission to order a cease and desist and abate
the fees and added the rent increase was unfair. The interpreter repeated statement to Mr. Kizawi and stated
his response. He stated I am mostly happy there; we have a copy of the checks submitted monthly and they
were never late. We have been there for 6 years, and we are like a family, we don’t have any problems and
are the ideal tenants. Broadmoor doesn’t look at it that way, they don’t have any mercy and instead of
rewarding the good tenants, they make an unreasonable increase on the rent and start an eviction. I’ve been in
this country for 7 years with no violation of the law, I go to work, home, work, and home. I have no friction with
the law whatsoever. My wife cries every day because of attending court. Attorney Lee stated he had to put Mr.
Kizawi under oath if he was going to testify.
Mr. Kizawi was sworn in. Commissioner Robinson placed several documents on record and confirmed the
landlord’s attorney had the opportunity to view. The exhibits excluded check copies, leases, court eviction
documents, residence application, letters from neighbors, tow receipt and an unsigned lease. Mr. Kizawi stated
that the kitchen ceiling had a leak and when asked for it to be fixed it took 2 months and that the bathroom
ceiling also leaked and was again told to wait. The was also mold in the apartment.
Attorney Mastrianni requested that Attorney Burns and himself could speak privately. The request was
granted, and Attorney Burns left the room. Attorney Burns returned and requested a continuance and to be
heard at a later date because all parties agreeing to try and settle outside of the FRC. A motion was made to
continue case at the December meeting and was granted by the Commission.
c. Case #23-003 Kiana Gurley: Ms. Gurley was not present, and Paul Boudreau from Hamden Tenants Union
stated that Ms. Gurley moved and did not know a current address. Salvatore McClain stated that the case was
heard prior and was continued. Several letters, emails were sent and attempts to call but her number was
disconnected. Mr. McClain stated that several attempts were made to contact Ms. Gurley. Commissioner
Robinson motioned to closed the case and all agreed.
d. Case #23-013 Angela Cameron: Commissioner Robinson stated several documents to be included on
record. The exhibits were area comparable rentals submitted by Hamden Tenants Union. All new exhibits
were distributed to all parties and the Commission. Paul Boudreau spoke on behalf of Ms. Cameron and stated
that they wanted to know why it took almost a year for the case to be heard. He stated the case was filed in
October 2022 and Ms. Cameron was forced to sign a lease before the hearing, she received a notice to quit
and was made to pay an additional $350 a month. He stated she signed the sign out of fear of losing her
housing for her and her children. And additional was trying to charge her for the fee for the notice to quit.
He stated that Ms. Cameron lived at Seramonte for about 8 years, her and her children were rooted in Hamden
as respected members of the community. He stated that many of the years were lived without any issues but
time and time again the problems began when Northport Management bought the property. He stated that this
was a pattern seen over and over here and expected it to continue until Mr. Horowitz and Northport
Management is properly held accountable for ignoring the laws of both Connecticut and the Town of Hamden.
He stated that Ms. Cameron requested many times that repairs be made to her washer, dryer, dishwasher, and
bathroom, only to be told there’s nothing wrong with them. Her bathroom has a water leak and possible mold,
her dishwasher and washer has to be run several times to get things clean and her dryer doesn’t turn off and
keeps running unless you open the door which seems to be a huge fire risk at a time when Seramonte seems
to be burning like the Bronx in the seventies. He stated that Seramonte had another big fire last night and 22
people were displaced. And do we need an additional fire risk at this point? Have any of these gad dryers been
serviced like they’re supposed to be annually or ever. Time and time again we hear during the hearings how
Seramonte has done everything to avoid its responsibilities to its tenants and to the town of Hamden.
And then go on and try and squeeze hundreds more out of the tenants who are forced to live in subpar
conditions. Ms. Angela is no exception when tenants demand that their complex be properly maintained.
Those tenants are met with intimidation, retaliation, and flat our refusal from the landlord to follow the laws.
That was my opening statement and Ms. Cameron is going to testify now.
Attorney McEleney stated and just for the record, I didn’t want to interrupt but I want to put it on the record in
each hearing that I object to a non-lawyer acting effectively as counsel, even in a municipal proceeding, and
that’s the unauthorized practice of law.
Paul Boudreau, representative from the Hamden Tenant’s Union, greeted Ms. Cameron and asked her
address, how long did she live at Seramonte and what she did for a living. Ms. Cameron answered she lived at
138 Kay View Dr, she lived there for almost 8 years and that she was a teacher. Mr. Boudreau stated so you’re
a local educator here in Connecticut. He asked did anyone live with her. Ms. Cameron stated her two older
children and that one works at Shop-Rite and the other at Amazon. She also has 2 younger children that were
adopted trauma children, and one is currently being tested for autism. Stated she had a lot of friends at
Seramonte and that the community there was tight. Neighbors will babysit when she had emergencies and
would pick her baby from school. She stated her neighbor were supportive.
Paul Boudreau asked how hard it would be to move and not have her neighbors around her and how hard
would it be on the children to not have their friend nearby. Ms. Cameron stated the adjustment would be
difficult because they had gone through so much already and the move would just devastate the entire family
and there’s an old saying kids need a village and her kids need a village. Mr. Boudreau asked what was her
rent when she filed a year ago. Ms. Cameron stated she was paying $2,100 and it was increased to $2,450
without notice or tell her about signing a new lease. She called several times in June with no response until she
went to the office. She stated that personnel from the office that they would not give her a notice to quit if she is
late on her rent. Ms. Cameron stated she already had to pay so many of them, cause she missed a month
already. She stated she only paid just half of Septembers rent. She only paid $1,000 dollars and has yet to pay
the additional $1,450 and the office said they would not charge her a late fee. She also stated that if she
needed help to contact the Keefe Community Center.
Mr. Boudreau stated so they told you to go, get the money from the town of Hamden and attempting to charge
you their legal fees. Ms. Cameron stated yes and they have done this many times because she has been late
already. Mr. Boudreau asked, and you were served a notice to quit and that’s how they got you to sign the
lease. She stated yes in June. She stated the washer and dry, you have to keep washing and drying the cloths
and the dishwasher needs to run more than twice it increases her electricity. There’s a leak in the sink but did
not fix the tile or the leak. Theres mildew in the master bedroom, said they would fix but still hasn’t. She stated
her daughter’s car was towed because when she comes in late from work there is no parking, so she parked in
a visitors parking spot and was towed. It cost close to $300 dollars.
Mr. Boudreau asked how much did she make monthly and she stated $2,200 to $2,300 and that is doesn’t
even touch the rent with a high electricity bill. She stated she is always late because she only makes $2,300 a
month. Mr. Boudreau asked did she receive any other income and does she make $2, 400 a month or every 2
weeks. Ms. Cameron stated her children helps with the electricity and food and she gets paid $1,2000 - $1,300
every two weeks on the 15th
and the 30th
. Mr. Boudreau said, so a huge percentage of your income goes
towards your rent roughly. She said yes. He asked did she have anything else to say. She stated yes, she
wanted her rent to go back down because it’s to much for her to pay and her income does not support it.
She also stated they Seramonte does not fix anything, and they did not give her enough time to find a new
place even if she wanted to. She was hoping they would lower the increase because $350 dollars is a large
lump sum. Mr. Boudreau ended his questioning.
Attorney McEleney for Seramonte asked Ms. Cameron, just to clarify, is this a town home apartment with 3
bedrooms, 2 and a half bathrooms? Ms. Cameron said yes. Attorney McEleney asked when did you move in
and have you been in this unit the whole time or did you change units. Ms. Cameron she never changed.
Attorney McEleney said he just wanted to confirm the timeline and wanted permission to screen share.
Attorney McEleney point out that she signed a new lease in May 2022 for $2350 and was already entered into
more than 5 months before submitting a complaint with the FRC. Ms. Cameron said yes.
Attorney McEleney stated that we established you did not file your complaint until October 2022, correct. Ms.
Cameron stated she believed so because that was the date when she contacted Paul. Attorney McEleney
asked did she signed a new lease in May 2023 with an increase of $100, increasing from $2,350 to $2,450 and
Ms. Cameron replied yes and that a big chunk came before. Attorney McEleney asked how many people live
with her over the age 18, their ages and are they employed full time. Ms. Cameron responded 2 and their 26
and 27, both go to school online and work. Attorney McEleney stated that she testified that when she signed
the lease renewal, she was behind on rent when it was presented. Ms. Cameron stated the she just paid what
she was behind on and went in the office and asked her if she can get a lease and what’s happening because
she didn’t get a response prior. She stated she want to find what was the reason she wasn’t responded to and
was told they was sure how much her increase was going to be, that why she didn’t get a response. Attorney
McEleney had no further questions.
Commissioner Robinson asked were the appliance been repair and Ms. Cameron stated they were the same
and that he stove was electric and gas, that’s why her electricity is extremely high. Commission Bradford
stated that she needed electricity to ignite the gas. But you need to find out if your gas dry is because is the she
can call the gas company and they may tag it if it’s not working properly. Ms. Cameron stated that they patch
the holes up and was not done properly so air escapes the vent to the basement. They just not doing what they
need to get done. Commissioner Bradford asked was a work order submitted and Ms. Cameron said yes, and
they do a patch job and then nothing else is done. And then it’s the same thing again, they start repairs and
don’t finish.
Commissioner Robinson asked was the upstairs bathroom still leaking and she stated that the mold is still there
and seeing more mold now. Ms. Cameron stated that they said it’s in the roof, it bad and they will come back,
which has been over a month now. They keep looking at it, trying to fix it, and not doing it correctly, and it will
be a big fix and they’re not touching it.
Paul Boudreau asked to redirect and asked were Ms. Cameron’s full-time children time students right now and
Ms. Cameron stated yes, and they are about to finish school. Mr. Boudreau asked, and they only work part
time, and she stated yes.
Attorney McEleney recapped the dates signed on the leases, exhibits about increased cost. Showed showing
that there was negative Noi, this property for 2 million dollars. And then this exhibit in the record. So, you can
look at, you can look at the different income and the different expenses here. But basically, this all matches up
to. There's a 2-million-dollar hole, not a surplus for this property. I've also shown you before. Some of the
exhibits about the increased costs. So, I'll show this exhibit, which has also been put in the record just to say
that you know, over the course of time the mortgage has gone way up. We also know it's all variable rate
mortgage. So, this is where it was going, as of May of 2023 31% increase that continued to increase with
variable rates. Water costs have gone up. 56%, utilities have gone up. Millions of dollars in improvements
have been put into the property and most importantly, taxes have gone way way way up. I mean the taxes that
increased over 2-year period just per unit. And this would be more for this unit, because attribute more bigger
units, such as town homes would be 6, 59 a month. So, I do have argument as well. I can wait for that for the
end. But I wanted to. You know, just highlight those exhibits into evidence as well.
Attorney Lee asked, have you provided the time with a copy of the first 2 exhibits that you submitted the leas
and the addendum? Attorney McEleney stated Yes, attorney, all these exhibits should have been submitted
prior to the hearing, and I believe when Salvatore McClain sent around exhibits earlier, he had all those so they
should be in the file.
All parties was allowed brief summations. Paul Boudreau said, Thank you, Commissioner. You know we we've
heard all the testimony. So, I'm not going to recap almost anything. first. I want to say, you know. Originally, a
year ago we were looking to try to get some repairs and stop a hundred dollar increase because of the time she
spent living with disrepair appliances and the extra money she was spending on electricity. We keep hearing
the term fair market value. I ask, you know, who is it fair to who comes up with these values? The answer is the
landlords and the real estate people. and letting these greedy landlords decide what fair market value is. Se.
Seems a little crazy, and then we're using that number to base their rents on. We keep trying to compare
Seramonte to other complexes as well. But let's face facts. Other places all over Hamden have much better
amenities, much better maintenance look nicer or safer, and tenants at these complexes are not consistently
being victimized and intimidated by the landlords. I'm asking that the Commissioner base their decisions on the
matter at hand and not be distracted by graphs and spreadsheets.
We're asking that Ms. Cameron's rent be abated for the next 6 months, due to the intimidation, retaliation, and
illegal rent increases for the months of July, August, and September that Miss Angela and her family hadn't to
endure, as well as filing a notice to quit against her, which is also against the Frc. Ordinance, while a complaint
has been filed. All this is against the ordinance, while a complaint is filed. If there was a problem, they should
have gone to the Fair Rent Commission and not just bullied Ms. Angela around. When we asked that the rent
be held at 20. We also asked that the rent be held at 2,100 for the 6 months following the 6-month abatement,
because of the refusal to perform proper repairs for an entire year. While we were waiting to hear. It's not the
tenant's responsibility to make sure the landlord is a good businessman, and knows how to take out a
mortgage properly, or knows how to buy a property that isn't too expensive and not paid too much for it.
Attorney McEleney said Commissioner. So, I want to start by saying, really, what's in this Commission's
purview to decide this particular case, and you're here to look at unconscious, harsh, and unconscionable rent
increases, and I know we've been over that term before. But you know, in this case it's particularly stark,
because the rent was 2350 long before there was a case. That's the baseline, for we're dealing with here as the
Commission's jurisdiction not to go back and unwind multiple years of leases and multiple years of extensions.
It was 2350 before we started any of this, and you know in the long term that it's been dealing with, it's only
gone up a hundred dollars to 2450, and the market dynamics have to be taken into account. We've what we've
heard about before. These are large townhouse units that are basically like their own home. They go for $2,700
all day in this complex. So that's not worrying about a different complex with a different set of amenities. That's
what these units rent for, and that they're effectively all spoken for because they are valuable. They are big.
There's very few units on the market that are 3 beds, 2 and a half baths. And that's why, you know for
jurisdiction it's$ 2,350 before it gets to the Commission, and then, when it was increased to $2,450.
That is an accord and satisfaction that there was assignment reach to go forward and fix it for the another.
Another year the tenant gets the benefit of that bar, and then locks in another lease for another year, and you
know, when it easily could not have been renewed for nonpayment or a host of other issues. And now we have
that settlement. So now we can't be going undoing leases that have done before with the market. We can't be
going and undoing leases that are signed as a settlement, even with this settlement, is for a modest increase of
only $100. And I realized that there is procedural issues with getting all these heard. And this is a busy
document. There's been things here, but we also, you know it's not only the tenants who, taking issue with the
time, but the landlord, could take issue with the time to. This has been pending for a year.
So, all parties understand what the issues are, what their rights are. A lot of times these complaints are vague.
It's not easy to communicate with people, certainly not the Union in the time period when these are pending,
and it is important to deal with these things quickly, and I think that's true for both sides, and I don't think it is
fair to be going looking back for a year time
period, to try to, you know, do anything for these. And I think when we're looking at these, it's important to have
this. This is a one whole picture. We can't isolate variables and any transaction pick and choose just what we
like and say, Okay.
What the Tenant union is arguing? Who cares about market? Who cares about what rent you have to pay.
Who cares about what the tact down taxes are, or what interest is, or any of the expenses on a landlord is, and
people should just be of able to pay what they, you know, feel they can afford. But on the flip side, if
something's outdated, if there's an appliance that's older or is not to a certain extent you can't have both. We're
going to have all this sub-service and all new amenities and all new appliances you need to get to at market at
least. And never mind, hey? Say, we're going to hold all this stuff to market. So, I think that some of these
tenant arguments are a little bit of just looking at one side of the equation without acknowledging the other half.
So, when you get into those equities, I think that's important to keep in mind.
But for this case we really don't have to do that, because again, we're talking about a hundred-dollar increase.
It's within your purview, and then even then we have an accord, and satisfaction is signed, and when there are
late rent there are landlord and tenant who go to negotiate and sign leases ripping them up, not because
they're properly challenged increases ahead of time, but because we're gonna go Monday morning
quarterback it and undo deals that parties have done. I don't think is properly within the legal authority of this
commission. Thank you.
Conte Robinson: Counselor, I have a question. When was the notice to quit filed against Ms. Cameron.
Kevin McEleney: Commissioner, I have no idea that was I'm not saying it wasn't I haven't heard of it. This news
to me. I did not get an exhibit showing any indication of it. I tried to look it up on the docket to see if I could find
it online, and I don't see any evidence of it. So, if it was, it was not something we hit a docket, certainly nothing
that went through my office.
Mr. Boudreau: May I ask a quick question? Was that a legal notice to quit that was sent?
Kevin McEleney stated that if it wasn't signed on a document, then was it actually a notice to quit? Or was it a
pretend one. and see! Notices to quit are not filed. So that's a false choice. It's not how the process works, and
this is the part of bring with evidence we're putting in the complaint. It's I realize that people are not all
attorneys, and I don't think you are expected to hold to that standard. But if there was a complaint about
retaliation, or a complaint about a notice to quit, or complaint to about something like this, it should be in a
complaint before the Fair Rent Commission, so I can have any idea that exists, or look into it. It was not these.
This is a complaint that was brought in October of 2022 to at this point. So going back and saying, hey, I have a
complaint about what happened last month. There's no legal notice of it. There's no due process of it. There's
no exhibits indicating it. And this is part of the problem of when some of these things go on for a year. And so
that's not the cat's fault, but it is to say we have to keep the process adhering to the case that's actually
pending before the Commission. And the case is pending before the Commission is a filing from October of
2022. And these issues that someone could say who are literally late people that don't know.
Maybe, how all the legalities of the eviction process work to say, Oh, this happens without a document, without
a document, without anything that I'm aware of before the hearing or it can respond to. There's no real way of
doing that. I don't think that could be considered in the record other than the fact that it seems like landlord and
tenant had a disagreement over payment, and came to an arrangement on the lease, which is undisputed. We
do have documented evidence of.
Commissioner Robinson: Next case. Case number 23-015.
e) Case #23-015 Carolyn Huckabee: Case dismissed due to several missed hearings. Notices, calls, and
emails sent with no response.
f) Case #23-014 Florence Ardolino: Ms. Ardolino was sworn in. The landlord Quinnipiac University was
represented by Keith Woodward and was present but left the zoom meeting at some point. Commissioner
Robinson asked Mr. McClain to try and contact the landlord but got no response.
Attorney Lee: Thank you. Do you swear and affirm that the evidence and testimony give today will be the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth under penalties of perjury.
Florence Ardolino: I do.
Attorney Lee: Thank you.
Commissioner Robinson: Okay, Miss Ardolino, you're representing yourself?
Ardolino: I'm sorry, I apologize, yes.
Commissioner Robinson: Okay, so you are. You are representing yourself. Do you want to? Just briefly tell me
the facts and what you're asking for, based on your complaint.
Florence Ardolino: Absolutely, as briefly as possible. I am not complaining about the upkeep of the home that I
live in. Quinnipiac has been a very good landlord. What I am or that my complaint was that the red was the
event. Increase was excessive. It was in the approximately 29.40% of what my old rent was, and they said that
they had done comparisons in the neighborhood, and they were coming in at 2,200 to greater. And of course,
comparisons in Hamden are going to be sky high and 95 to 98% of the houses in my immediate area are
always.
Once I made a complaint. Well, they wanted to go from 1,700 to 2,200. They never sent me a letter telling me
that they were going to do this, but they started sending me a monthly bill, which is their how they get their rent.
They send the monthly bill, and I noticed that it went to $2,000, which is an increase of about 17.6 5% over
what it was, but I paid it. I didn't question it. I had no problem with it. My problem was that I didn't. Well, I didn't
feel that a $500 a month increase was, you know, was there at all. Considering I take care of all my upkeep. It
is my washer and dryer. They have done some major repairs, but they were capital improvements, nothing that
I requested or needed, and I get no services whatsoever. It's not like I'm a student, so I get my I take care of my
own. Well, landscaping my own snow, plowing at my own shrubs, everything is on me which I haven't have not
had any problem. And I to go back. I've lived in the Home for 19 and at 19 and a half years.
I maintain that home in pristine condition. Many, many of maintenance men from come in and have commented
on how lovely the houses, and how much they enjoy coming to my house when I put in a repair complaint,
because it is a pleasant house to go to. So, I attempted to get this settled prior to hearing, and what I offered
them. I did not sign the lease, but I still do get my monthly bill and I do pay it on it. And in the 19 plus years I
have never bounced to check. I've never missed the payment, and I have never been late with a payment.
So, what I talked with Mr. McClain about I had asked if they would continue to hold the rent at $2,000 between.
This was last. This was like in from October one to May 31st of 2024, remain at 2,000, and give me an
extension through the following, through September of 2024, at the 20, at the $2,000, and apparently, they
rejected that offer.
What I would like to see is that my rent remain at the $2,000 between now November one, because I already
paid my October so November one to the May 31st, or May thirtieth, to remain at $2,000, and then I would I
had. We have no problem agreeing to an extent to a an additional year's lease at that point now a year,
because they will not give me a partial yearly lease. I'll attend to 12 and a half percent increase over the
$2,000. I would have no problem with that; however, I would like to ask them if they would give me a fall clean
up, and a spring cleanup. I will still maintain the lawn every week, and I will still maintain the snow plowing as I
have been and just to give you a little bit of more information about myself.
Florence Ardolino: 2 years ago, or 2 to 2, maybe 2 and a half or 3 years ago I heard through the grapevine from
people on the street that were renting from Quinnipiac that they were going up from 1550, a month to the
1,700. Well, I started paying the $1,700 to them even before they notified me of the renting lease, and I, you
know, because I enjoy living on the road I live on. I am part of the community there. And I my roots are now
here in Hamden. They weren't always. But for 19 and a half years I have been in Hamden, and I would like to
remain, at least for another year and a half, if not more. I have. And again, I have no issues with Quinnipiac as
a landlord, but a 30% increase in rent is quite unconscionable.
And then I mean, and you can't compare the houses because of the fact that they are all owned by Quinnipiac.
My Quinnipiac probably owns 9 houses on my road, and just recently they started putting students in the
houses. But we, you know I have no problems, no issues with them as well. They're, you know. They're a great
landlord, as far as that goes. My complaint was that I just thought my rent was rather unfair, and that's why I
took it to the fair rent permission.
Commissioner Robinson: I don't have any questions. Does anyone on the Commission have any questions?
Commissioner Nedd: I do. I do.
Commissioner Nedd: Miss Ardolino: are you currently employed?
Florence Ardolino: I am retired.
Commissioner Nedd: Thank you.
Attorney Lee: My question was, and you may have said, and I apologize. You were paying $1,700 or rent
pursuant to a lease. When did that lease expire and when did they try to put you into a new lease?
Florence Ardolino: That lease expired in May 31st of this year and that's when they sent me the notice, telling
me, you know, that it was going to go up $500.
Attorney Lee: And then since June first you've been paying $2,000 a month?
Florence Ardolino: Since June 13th, when I made my complaint.
Attorney Lee: And your complaint was dated June thirteenth. Is that right?
Florence Ardolino: I believe, oh, let's see, where do we have a date. Yes, when I find it. It was June 13th, 2023,
yes. And I have been paying the $2,000 a month.
Commissioner Cunningham: And aside from you, made them an offer of $2,000, and then they rejected that?
Florence Ardolino: I made them an offer of $2,000 in to start in October of this year through September of next
year, and they rejected that. So ,spoke to a few people, and I was encouraged to take it to the Rent
commission and continue on and have a hearing. And, as I said, I'm not inverse to it. Going up. I am just
inverse to the amount.
Commissioner Cunningham: Okay? And that's so. You haven't had any other correspondence with them other
than to make that offer and to have it rejected. They haven't. They haven't made any, they haven't tried to find
you or anything like that for.
Florence Ardolino: No, they've been sending me the bill, and I've been sending them rent, and they've been
cashing the checks.
Commissioner Cunningham: Thank you very much.
Florence Ardolino: Thank you.
Commissioner Robinson: You have any documents that you want to have made part of the record?
Florence Ardolino: I do not. I just will. I will reiterate the fact that there, as far as being a landlord, they're great.
If I have a problem, I put in a work order, and they come right out. I have no issues with any of anything like
that. And however, I do worry, and it's something that's kind of been a theme tonight. I worry that if you find in
my favor that, I'm a little worried about retaliation now, if I call them with a repair order, or I need a new stove,
or I need a new refrigerator, because those are included in the lease. Then I don't. I do not want to have a
situation where they're going to say, oh, well, we'll put you on the bottom of the list, you know, cause I've never
had any issues with them prior to this.
Commissioner Robinson: Does anybody have any other questions?
Commissioner Robinson: Alright, ma'am. anything else?
Florence Ardolino: That would be it. Thank you very much for your time.
Commissioner Robinson: No, thank you.
Commissioner Robinson: Alright. Next case is 23, 0 2, one, Adam Weber.
Commissioner Robinson: Hello, Mr. Weber, we're going to have you sworn in?
Commissioner Robinson: Is the landlord's council, or is the landlord present?
Salvatore McClain: Yes.
Commissioner Robinson: I see them. Okay, can we have them brought up?
Joanne Aviles: This is Joanna Aviles. I'm the vice President of the property management for Jones Street,
residential. The owners of Town Walk and I have Lauren Lennox, manager for Tom Walk as well.
Commissioner Robinson: Hi, is your camera? Are you able to turn on cameras? See if I can?
Commissioner Robinson: Yep, you're here. Alright. Are you going to be testifying or are you just here as a
representative.
Joanne Aviles: I'm here as a representative, and to back up Lauren. If she has anything that she'd like. Also, for
me to add.
Commissioner Robinson: okay, so, Laura, and you're going to testify. Yes.
Attorney Lee: anybody who's going to be testifying. Please raise your right hand. Do you swear in a firm under
the penalties of perjury, that you will give the truth the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
Lauren Lenox: Yes.
Commissioner Robinson: Okay, so I'll give you the ground rules. We're going to try to keep this as concise as
possible. Every party has 10 min for testimony. We're going to allow 10 min for cross, and we can do a brief
closing argument. And then the Commission will make a decision. Please don't interrupt any of the
Commissioners and commissioners may interject at any time during your testimony, okay, alright.
Mr. Weber, do you want to? State facts? And the relevant facts to your case. And as and what you want as far
as relief from the Commission.
Adam Weber: Yes, good evening, members of the Fair End Commission. I've raised a description of the events
that led me to file a complaint, so I'll just give a summary as a reminder, and then address the events that have
happened since filing the complaint.
On May sixth a fire destroyed a large portion of building 27 at Town Walk, where I lived. My apartment was
across the hall from the majority of the damage, so was not substantially affected. However, I was still
displaced, and not allowed to live in the building. After the fire was extinguished, I was sorted, escorted back in
for just a few minutes by the fire department to pack a bag of essentials, and then I moved back in with my
parents in Milford.
On May eighth Tera Camillo, a Jones Street employee, who was overseeing the fire response, gave me a call
to let me know that they would be able to relocate me to a vacant unit on town walk properly in a different
building. She also stated that I would be able to regain access to my apartment in the next 48 hours. Based on
this information, I signed a new lease on May tenth, and was given the keys that day.
Since I had already agreed to a lease renewal back in April for my old unit, because I really enjoyed living at
Town Walk. Said they would simply use my renewal, lease terms, and change the unit number and start date.
I agreed to sign the new lease just a few days after fire, because Miss Camillo made it sound like we would be
able to get back into the building very soon and get our belongings. This turned out to be false. On May
seventeenth a structural engineer's report was published regarding the damage to building 27. I asked town
block management for the report, and I was ignored. I asked the town of Hampton Building Department for the
report, and I was ignored.
I finally filed a freedom of information request for the report and received it shortly after. In this report it clearly
stated that my specific unit 2, 7, 3, 3, has 0 issues regarding accessing the units, whereas other units were
classified access with caution or even after stating this to town walk, they refuse to let me know when I would
be able to access my rightful property locked inside the building because they didn't change the locks and put a
fence around the building
I contacted United Restoration, the company overseeing the cleanup. I contacted the town building department
and the town fire department, and everyone seemed to be pointing the finger at Town Walk for the reason for
the delay. On May 20 fifth I was permitted access for just 1 h to grab small belongings under the supervision of
United Restoration.
But it was made clear that furniture moving was not permitted during this time. Just so I could fit in my car. On
May 20 sixth, I sent my first email to town walk management, asking for a one month rent credit to be applied to
my ledger because of the massive delay so far, with no end in sight. Although, yes, I had the keys to my new
apartment in building 11. Most of my personal belongings were still locked away in building 27, including all my
furniture, my bed, cookware, toiletries, most clothing, and electronics.
I would not have all the belongings necessary to actually live in my new unit without having to purchase
everything brand new. I sent 7 emails in total to different employees of town wall requesting a rent credit for
the delay of occupancy on their part, every time the email chain ended without addressing my concern. Even
one time Miss Camillo gaslit me by saying, we place the credit on your unit for the days you were displaced
from Unit 2, 7, 3, 3, until you were able to move into your new Home End quote. While sure that they gave me a
rent credit for the 3 days between the fire and signing the new lease. It was false. I had no quote, moved into
my new home. I was still living in Milford at that time.
Finally, on June eighth, with less than 24 h notice given by Miss Camillo. I was permitted to hire a moving
company for the remainder of my belongings, and be began residing my new unit that day, also, because of the
less than 24 h. Notice, the moving company added on some rush fees, which was a bigger claim for my
insurance before moving onto the events that have transpired since then. One key point to note. Every former
resident of building 27 will attest that the fire alarms did not function the day of the fire residents only evacuated
because the neighbor who first saw the fire pulled the lever in the hallway, and nothing happened.
They then ran through the whole building, while it was actively burning down, risking their own lives to bang on
everyone's door to make sure we got out of there. As it was 4 30 Am. And we were all sleeping. The only noise
that morning was the crackling of the fire engulfing the building and the screens of residents.
Town walk was grossly negligent in ensuring that our fire alarms actually worked. But this is unfortunately not
surprising. As an email. Back in March sent from a Joan Street employee, Elizabeth Dooley, explaining why the
amenity fee was increasing this year. The very first item in the list of amenities was fire pull stations, town lock,
considers fire, pull stations to simply be amenities and not required lifesaving equipment because it was clear
that town walk did not want to do the right thing, and credit me for my delay of occupancy on their part. I filed
my complaint with this commission.
My case was originally scheduled for last month, but given the continuance to this hearing, I thought I would
use the time to try to offer Town Walk one last chance to negotiate internally, so that we would not have to use
our time tonight.
I got a meeting with Vice President, Miss Joan of Eilis, who is here tonight, who was made familiar with
everything regarding my situation when we met. It was very strange, because she said she discussed the
matter with her colleagues and stated that she would have no problem granting me a one month rent credit.
which seemed to be a complete 1. 80 from the way town walk was treating my previous 7 requests before I filed
the complaint.
However, in order to receive this rent credit, I would simply have to sign a 6 page. Mutual release and
settlement agreement prepared by their attorneys, in which I would sign away nearly every right that I have.
This is in deep contrast to when Town Walk applied the 3 days of rent credit after the fire, no questions asked,
no settlement agreements, no notarized signatures.
My opinion, Jones Street is attempting to buy my silence with one month of rent credit because they think I care
more about money and holding people accountable for their actions. Although I felt insulted at first when
presented with this over-the-top settlement.
I'm now just that, as I've given Jones Street 8 chances, 8 chances to do the right thing, and every time they
make the decision which either made them more money or protected their reputation.
And what really makes me sick is that these are the actions they took towards the victim of a fire. an event that
will live with me forever, an event that still traumatizes me to this day, when I wake up in the middle of the night
and think the building is burning down because it is silent. But I'm not surprised because it's not a landlord's job
to do the right thing, and landlords. Job is to extract as much money from tenants as possible, and I know for a
fact that Miss Joanna Aviles is a bit scared that we're here tonight. Public testimony regarding a Connecticut
Senate bill called a right to housing, which would have established fair rent commissions in certain towns, as
well as protected victims of domestic violence. Miss Aviles opposed the entire bill.
She wrote that fair rent commissions are, quote a tool for tenants to bash landlords with end quote. I feel that
she's wrong and fair rent commissions are one of the only tools that people have to hold. Landlords
accountable when they unfairly take advantage of their tenants.
Therefore, commissioners, I am asking you to use your powers to reduce my total rental charges to $1 per
month for both the months of November and December, as I've already paid October rent to effectively equal 2
months of rent credit, one month for the entire month, I was actually displaced for my unit, living with my
parents in Milford, yet still paying rent during this delay of occupancy, because all my belongings necessary for
a habitable apartment, were locked in building 27 and the second month to account for the actions which I
consider to be retaliation by the landlord, including ignoring all my emails about Red credit and trying to shut
me up through a settlement agreement that would have taken all my rights away just to get a bit of money.
As well as the gross negligence of town, walk in Jones Street in adequately testing and providing functional fire
alarms and the resulting trauma that I and every former resident of building 27 now live with. Thank you.
Commissioner Robinson: Do you have any questions for Mr. Weber based on his testimony?
Commissioner Robinson: I'm asking the landlord's representative.
Commissioner Robinson: No, okay.
Commissioner Robinson: Does commission. Have any questions for Mr. Web Weber at this time.
Commissioner Robinson: Mr. Webber. I just one question. So, I just wanted to establish. You did not have use
of your apartment. Because of your belongings in your and your furniture in your other apartment, and that was
for one month.
Adam Weber: Yes, the fire was on May sixth, and I was finally able to move on. June eighth. I had the keys
since May tenth, but nothing to actually live in a habitable apartment without having to purchase everything
brand new.
Commissioner Robinson: I don't have any other questions. Does anyone have any questions?
Commissioner Robinson: Alright? Well, we'll hear from the landlord.
Lauren Lenox: Hi, my name is Lauren Lennox. I was the associate portfolio manager with Jones Street
residential. I was the acting community manager. I was the community manager for several years. And Town
Walk had recently transferred to a different property with the Jones Street residential portfolio during that time,
May. I was not the acting community manager. But I'm back at Town Walk now. That being said, I was
involved with the fire. I was there that day of the fire, and I have been very involved. Since then.
We had received there's a couple of points that I would like to address. We do understand that it was a
traumatic event for all parties involved. We were working with the building inspector at Diamond. The fire
marshals. We're there at the scene, and all the firefighters as well. With that we had received a notice of unsafe
structure. Dated May 20, third, and the fire did occur on May sixth.
That notice did state that the structure was unsafe and indicated that there were 21units with that that was
mailed directly to Joan Street Residential. It went to our Boston office who notified us in which we signed off
and acknowledged it and sent it back to the city in terms of a structural engineer. Report and anything in writing
from Diamond, formerly, on this letterhead from the town of Hamden, stating that the structure was no longer
unsafe.
We had never received that 21 units were deemed in head inhabitable by fire. Therefore, as of May sixth, that
resulted in a chain of events happening where residents, of course, were not allowed back into their unit. The
units were locked down that day. Ed Diamond, the building inspector, did put stickers on, all of them,
condemning them that day. And we needed to lock those units down, and they did not leave until all the units
were secured.
However, at various pieces of time after that the building inspector and we were on the phone every day and
would allow us to give a small window of opportunity to allow residents to take their belongings out. Depending
on the unit itself would be depending on if they were allotted to do it with a fire marshal present or if they were
allowed to do it escorted by a representative, and of course all of those things take time. The fire happened on
May sixth. The letter occurred to us formally on May twenty-third. And I have 2 waivers of Adam going in on the
first date, being May 20 fifth to pick up belongings. Again, the building inspector and all parties involved were
very concerned about that structure.
And the second being another Waiver, dated June eighth as well. In terms of the leases. All residents were that
were involved with the fire, or in building 27 if they wanted to terminate their lease effective May fifth. We
absolutely granted that no questions asked, so if anybody from building 7 wanted to leave and never come
back to town wall that that lease was terminated. We worked very hard and very quickly, and we worked with
the local hotels and American Red Cross to get residents temporarily placed into temporary living conditions.
We're up against Yale Commencement weekend and so everybody had to vacate out of the hotels no later
than Friday, and we were able to place residents in new apartments for anybody who wanted to move back
onto the property. It was not a requirement. Again, as stated, if any resident wanted to terminate the lease as of
May fifth, we agreed to do so.
The credits that Adam is referring to are the time from May sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth. Adam took a new
lease with us, as of May tenth a new lease was signed, and also utilities put on in his name as well, in which
Adam did so. Keys were turned over on May 10 again, leases executed by both parties.
Unfortunately, due this to the sensitivity of the building. Yes, all parties were up against a very specific time
frame in which we could get residents into the building and get them quickly out of the building. Whether they
had movers or whether families were moving them, and family members and friends were moving them as well.
All residents who have wanted to collect their belongings at this time have done so. And I just want to
acknowledge. Yes, we did offer to settle this prior to this hearing as well. So, we did agree to a one month rent
credit with a release in which Adam declined at that point of time.
Lauren Lenox: Are there any questions for me? Does the Commission have any questions?
Commissioner Coggins: I have a question. So, following the fire, has there been in an investigation of the fire
alarm system in that building, and the other buildings at the at the apartment complex, or an inspection by the
town.
Lauren Lenox: Absolutely. The fire department has been on our property. They come on our property all the
time they've been through our building through the units. through the building itself that had the fire. They work
with us when we have the demo team there now, on making sure that everything is set up correctly. Our
system that we've set up for Demo doesn't impede any fire traps getting in and out of the community if they
should need to do so in the event of a future emergency. And yes, all the buildings were reinspected as well.
Commissioner Coggins: Just to clarify as part of that process, was there an inspection of the fire alarm systems
in the buildings and has it been confirmed that they are operational?
Lauren Lenox: As so, the building systems are operational and, as far as I'm aware, that was conducted at that
day, and future inspections were conducted as well. I have not received a report. And I believe this question
has been asked to the fire department as well if they have received a report for that day, I have not received
one at this time and you'd have to go to the Fire department if they have a report for it that day.
Adam Weber: Can I add something? As far as I'm aware, Connecticut State police are currently in the middle
of their investigation. They recently took my statement. For probably a few months.
Commissioner Robinson: I have a question for the landlord's representative. So, there's no dispute that
between May 10th
and May 15th, that Mr. Mr. Weber did not have access to his furniture in his old apartment.
There's no dispute about that?
Lauren Lenox: There is no dispute about that. I, the signed waiver that I have is dated June 8th
, however, if
Adam's record shows, June 15th, then we can go with June 15th. We do not know when somebody signs their
lease. We do not know the condition of some residents. Just let their furniture go because of the renter
insurance renters insurance that they had, so some residents didn't even try to retrieve their furniture. They just
left it there. So, we didn't have any knowledge of that. If there was any hold up of Adam moving into the
apartment or not based on. I'm not moving in because I don't have furniture. Please don't start my lease as a 5
10. Can you start that later?
Lauren Lenox: That was not a conversation at that time, but again to Adam's point he did not know, and he
stated here he did not know how long it would take. We can certainly understand that we did not know either
how long it would take.
Commissioner Cunningham: I have a question, I guess, for both parties. When was the offer made for the one-
month credit previously and what precisely where the terms of the of the credit being offered?
Joanne Aviles: I'd like to be able, answer but I may have to swear in, but I was the one that met with Adam at
that time.
Attorney Lee: Do you swear and affirm that the testimony and evidence you will hear tonight will be the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth and their penalties of perjury?
Joanne Aviles: I do, so I responded to an email that Adam had sent to Lauren, stating that he was interested in
settling his claim against town walk before the hearing today. At that point at which time that I scheduled a time
to meet with him personally. To, you know, deliver the agreement. The agreement basically said that you, we
would allow a one-month concession. And it was a standard, you know, non-disparagement. You know. No.
Speaking of the agreements, that's any normal agreement would be.
Commissioner Cunningham: okay. Thank you. Mister Weber, do you think that's a fair characterization of the
agreement that was offered?
Adam Weber: I think that's part of it. I mean, as I stated, when they applied the rent credit between May sixth
and May tenth, they just change the number in their computer system. I know for a fact, it's that easy to just
change a number. I didn't have to go through 6 pages of this, this is, it's basically a hush money settlement, I
mean. Not only was there like confidentiality cost. If I signed it, I would give away any right to ever hold town,
Walk, Jones Street accountable for anything in my lease in this complaint, anything on the property forever in
perpetuity? So basically, they want to shut me up because they know that I know a lot.
Commissioner Robinson: Any other questions?
Commissioner Robinson: Okay.
Commissioner Robinson: Does the parties want to add anything else?
Adam Weber: I will just add that I'm glad Miss Lennox addressed it, that when I you know, was presented? Do I
want to move off the property forever and terminate my lease? Or do I want to stay at town, walk? Those were
the only 2 options I was presented with. I don't understand why town walk was also unsure when I'd be able to
retrieve my stuff. Why, they couldn't pause or suspend my lease, or otherwise make the start, date the date that
they would eventually know I could move in. They wanted to start it as soon as possible, so they could start
collecting money as soon as possible.
Joanne Aviles: That is not the case. We offered the as soon as possible, so that we could not have tenants that
decided to come back to Tom Walk to be displaced.
Conte Robinson: Yeah. So, we have 2 different versions of that.
Conte Robinson: Does anyone have any other questions?
Conte Robinson: Alright, thank you.
Conte Robinson: Think that's it and neither party have anything else to add.
Conte Robinson: Okay, so thank you, Mr. Weber.
Adam Weber: Thank you.
Commissioner Robinson: Thank you.
Commissioner Robinson: Landlord and landlord representatives, thank you.
Commissioner Robinson: Alright. Can we have them taken down so we can discuss these cases.
Commissioner Cunningham: We will take a 2-minute break real quickly before we start.
Commissioner Robinson: Alright. We're ready. Is everyone ready to go. First case we need to discuss is Mr.
Abdul Kizawi.
Attorney Lee: I think we continue that one, right?
Commissioner Robinson: Yes, that's a continuance.
Commissioner Robinson: It seems hopeful that they'll reach a settlement.
Commissioner Cunningham: An agreement between the 2 parties. Oh, yes, so yeah, so.
Commissioner Robinson: But that'll be continued. We'll actually, we can discuss that at the end for scheduling
additional hearings in cases because that would be continued. But we have to vote on that to be continued. Is
that correct?
Attorney Lee: No, you you've already continued the hearing. I thought during the hearing you continued to the
December meeting of the Commission.
Commissioner Cunningham: December meeting.
Commissioner Robinson: So okay, so we don't need to hear it. Have that heard of on a motion that's fine.
Commissioner Robinson: So, Ms. Cameron, case number 23, dash 0 1, 3. The thing that bothered me about
the case that there was a lease, that she didn't agree with the landlord's attorney's characterization of it, but
there was a lease and we signed in May or June of this year during the dependency of her complaint. And it
was described as a settlement but it's obvious that she felt the way I view it. It's obvious that the overall
increase is too high, but it's obvious that she felt she had to sign in, and it was some something that she had to
do to make sure that she could remain in that remain in the apartment. I don't know if anybody else saw it that
way.
Commissioner Cunningham: Yeah, it was 2,100. Then they signed a lease over the summer for 2,300.
Commissioner Bradford: They were talking about $350 increase, but it was just a hundred dollars from the
prior lease.
Commissioner Robinson: and a prior lease was signed before the complaint you like for a second?
Commissioner Robinson: I understand how we would view it. They were going off to $2,100. But how do we
view it? If we view it as just a hundred dollars increase.
Commissioner Bradford: So actually, that's what it was.
Commissioner Robinson: Okay. And what about the fact that she does have use of her washing machine
based on her testimony? She doesn't have use of a washing machine and a dishwasher.
Commissioner Cunningham: Her complaint was October 20, ninth, 2022, so she had filed the complaint nearly
a year ago inside the lease between then and now.
Commissioner Robinson: Right. But the thing is she signed a lease with a pending complaint
Commissioner Cunningham: right?
Commissioner Robinson: So that would fall under the jurisdiction of the Fair Rent commission.
Commissioner Robinson: Am I right?
Commissioner Nedd: I thought she signed the lease and then filed a complaint.
Commissioner Robinson: That's correct. There's 2 leases that are that are signed right there. There was one
signed in 2022, and then there was another one signed in 2023.
Commissioner Robinson: We see it all the time with these this type of case. But there's leaks she said in the
bathroom roof, and she doesn't have use of her other appliances and they just aren't operating effectively. If
you, if you've got a run your dry and it doesn't stop, what good is it? It's not good. It's no good. You got to run
your dishwasher 2 or 3 times you don't have use of it.
Commissioner Robinson: The problem with the case is that I see the one issue she has, though, is that she?
She signed that lease prior to following her complaint.
Commissioner Coggins: But aren't we able to hear complaints about rent increases that have already been
implemented, and someone has already signed the lease with the understanding that they may, you know,
have felt that they didn't have a choice at that time.
Commissioner Robinson: yeah. And I definitely agree she did. She felt that I definitely think she did, felt that
way when she signed the second lease.
Commissioner Cunningham: Would you still have jurisdiction? There's no reason we couldn't make any finding
as long as there's a connected complaint given the facts but that is the timing of the leases is just a salient fact
of the of the case.
Commissioner Robinson: Is based on her testimony. Is that apartment and based at the comps set where that
were offered for the other apartments.
Conte Robinson: Is it worth $2,300, is it worth 49% of her income or monthly income?
Commissioner Coggins: I think, considering income and the maintenance factors, and the, you know, amenities
and availability of the appliances and all the other issues that were raised. No, that what she is receiving is not
worth what she's getting.
Commissioner Nedd: So, is it a matter she cannot. She's living in residing in an apartment that she cannot
afford.
Commissioner Robinson: Well, one, she can't afford it. Number 2. She's not getting the value of what they're
asking for. Now you saw the landlords justification for increasing the rent.
Commissioner Robinson: All these expenses. But there's no, there's no repairs made to. There's no repairs
made to the appliances. Things are leaking. So, my question is, number one, there's she can't afford to.
Obviously, she can't afford to pay. It's burdensome. The pay that amount they are asking you, but number 2
even if she were able to pay it, is it worth what they're asking for it. Based on the condition of the apartment like
that. That's the way I'm looking at it.
Commissioner Robinson: Okay, what do you think?
Commissioner Nedd: Well, perhaps I should ask more questions, but I know if they're appropriate. Certainly,
she has 2 minor children that have a history of trauma and require additional services. My question initially
would have been. Are these children legally adopted? Or are they fostered children because they're foster
children of Connecticut that comes with at least a set about income for regular foster care, but they're
therapeutic.
Commissioner Nedd: You get a bit more resources, and though each file secure child in the State of
Connecticut is attached to an agency that provides resources, medical, also food and additional services. I also
think that she signed the lease in May for the 2350 before filing a complaint as well, regarding things that are
not working. In October of that same year.
Commissioner Nedd: I think we should keep the rent at the 2350 and hold off on a $100 increase until
appliances are addressed. And to be a little bit more subjective, you have 3 adults in a home. And there's 3
sources of income, and I think a hundred-dollar increase. I don't think that's too much for 3 adults, but I want to
be sensitive to other things that may be at play in the home. So, in short, I feel that we should keep it at 2350,
and not adhere to the $100 increase until the appliances are fixed.
Commissioner Robinson: Alright, and I'm looking at her complaint, and she has the income of her family
members and got her income at 2,400. So, it comes out to $4,800 total. She doesn't indicate that she's getting
any money for or any type of foster care, or anything like that.
Commissioner Bradford: She did say that the children were her adopted children.
Commissioner Bradford: I'm just going off. What's on the complaint. But you know we don't know if you know
there's legal papers. We haven't seen anything in that regard, either.
Commissioner Robinson: even if they're just people, maybe if they're just relatives that are living with their, I
mean, does that change the situation?
Commissioner Nedd: Well, the reason why I brought that up because she had mentioned, she's barely able to
afford the rent where her children provide food. But when you have children who have additional needs and if
you know their systems to provide resources to those children and families, I don't even know if this is useful
information. But if you're fostering a State of Connecticut, that money that you get the additional resources that
comes in and check. It's not taxable. So, you don't have to report it. But that's a bit much, and I'm not trying to
investigate but just in terms of being fair.
Commissioner Bradford: So, Commissioner Ned, do you want to put your statement regarding the 2350 to a
motion?
Commissioner Nedd: Yes, I would move that we keep the rent at 2350 and hold off on the $100. Increase until
the repairs to the apartment in regards to the appliances and the leaking roof in the bathroom are completed.
Commissioner Bradford: I second the motion.
Commissioner Robinson: Anybody. We have anybody else that wants to add anything on this.
Commissioner Coggins: I would hold to the 2,100 just based on interpretation of the filing of the complaint and
the delay in the hearing for the case. I'm not sure what caused that delay, but considering the long period
between the time that the complaint was filed, and when it's being heard I feel like we should be looking at the
stats at the time of the complaint as well.
Commissioner Cunningham: I agree with Commissioner Coggins.
Commissioner Nedd: I'm sorry, but just to be clear. When the complaint was filed in October of 2022 she did.
The tenant was already paying 2350.
Commissioner Cunningham: Yeah, but the complaint was about that increase. She was initially asking to hold it
2,100 then. In the course of the year to figure the case, they increased it again to 2450. So really, in effect, if we
held it at 2350, we would be saying we'll be rejecting the initial complaint.
Commissioner Nedd: So once the appliances are taken care of in a matter 2 to 3 months, and then the rent
goes to 2450. How was she going to be able to, I mean. Okay, I think that we will be seeing this again. If she's
living in an apartment that she cannot afford.
Commissioner Robinson: How long do you want to have the 2,100 remain, in effect, until the repairs are made
to the appliances, because I agree. I don't think that the apartment is worth $2,400 or $2,300 based on her
testimony.
Commissioner Bradford: What they asked for, though Commissioner Robinson was an abatement for 6
months, and to hold a rent $2,100
Commissioner Robinson: Okay. So, we leave it in effect, for 6 months.
Attorney Lee: So, the motion on the table was for 2,350. So, either you have to act upon that motion, or that
motion has to be withdrawn. If somebody else wants to make a new motion.
Commissioner Robinson: okay. So, Mr. Ned, are you going to withdraw the motion?
Commissioner Nedd: I mean if you all disagree, and I will withdraw the motion.
Commissioner Robinson: Alright. So, the motion we would do would be $2,100 for a period of 6 months and the
appliances, specifically the drier, the dishwasher and the leaky bathroom be repaired.
Commissioner Cunningham: Could we do? 2,100 for a period of 6 months, and then 2350 for the duration of
lease apps. Give them time to make comparison.
Commissioner Bradford: You putting that to a motion?
Commissioner Cunningham: Yeah. So that would be so, for 6 months would be in November, December,
January, February, April. And then 2 months at 2350.
Commissioner Bradford: I second the motion.
Conte Robinson: All in favor.
Commissioners: Aye
Commissioner Cunningham: I make a second motion just to cease and assist any attempts at eviction. A notice
to quit anything along those lines. The counsel for the landlord said that he was aware of any notices to quit the
tenants representative claims that one was delivered either legitimately or not. But you know, I think, should
have it on the record that, you know there shouldn't be any notice to quit issues. I wouldn't limit that to notice
the quest for, based on a retaliation for filing a complaint with the fair rent Commission, because, yeah, the
landlord should have the ability. If there's a nonpayment of rent situation, any retaliatory notices to quit. So I'll
make that as a separate question.
Conte Robinson: I'll second the motion
Conte Robinson: All in favor.
Commissioners: Aye
Conte Robinson: Ms. Florence Ardolino.
Conte Robinson: The landlord wasn't present. There was an increase for her. Was, is that right?
Commissioner Bradford: From 1,700 to 2,200? However, when they, when they knew she filed a complaint.
They brought it down to 2,000, and that's what she's asking that to remain it.
Commissioner Robinson: So, she wants. She's asking to hold it at 2,000, which she voluntarily started paying.
Commissioner Cunningham: Until the end of May, and then she'd be willing to resign, at least with. She's also
asking for a bulk pickup for one to fall, and one in the spring. A what like a bulk pickup. I think she was asking.
She mentioned that.
Commissioner Robinson: can we order that? I don't think we can. Right? I think it's kind of beyond what you
normally do. Yeah, yeah. And what she said. She's responsible. She has been responsible for her own
landscaping and grass cutting and snow removal.
Commissioner Cunningham: Yeah, but I think her overall ask of holding rent at 2,000 until the end of May and
she indicated that the increase was what over 20%. That's excessive.
Commissioner Robinson: So, I will motion that the rent will remain in case number 23, 0 1, 4 at $2,000.
Salvatore McClain: She's also asking for an extension. Secondly, I don't know if you remember for year 2024.
And she said she would go up to 2,200.
Commissioner Robinson: We do that, though, would she have to? Would she have to submit a another
complaint that goes beyond our 12 months? Jurisdiction?
Commissioner Robinson: So, she would have to file another complaint.
Commissioner Nedd: But I think a request is reasonable. I think that increases absurd fixed income. And she
talked about, you know, being a part of the I mean a part of the community. But for 19 years I think she is the
community.
Commissioner Bradford: Hello, and so she's keeping up their property.
Commissioner Robinson: Okay, so I'll motion to keep rent at 2000, all in favor?
Commissioners: Aye
Commissioner Robinson: Okay, we have Adam Weber. At the very least. Adam, whoever gets is entitled to his
to his credit for one month because he did not have access to his furniture, could not make an insurance claim
based on what he said. And he and the landlord was willing to give him that, but they will also be holding
something over his head. I'll leave it at that, but I suspect I know what it was, but I don't want to. I don't even
want to get into that at this point But he definitely at the very least, gets the I mean there's no dispute that he
did not have access to his furniture or his belongings to make, or allowed to move into the new apartment so
effect effectively, had no use of the new apartment for at least one month.
Commissioner Bradford: Well, it's a month and 2 days
Commissioner Robinson: And then he was rushed. Then what he was rushed, and said they had to get to his
furniture out as soon as possible, and he was charging extra expense for the movers. And how much was that
expense?
Commissioner Bradford: That was never shared.
Commissioner Robinson: So, at the very least, I believe that's what the Commission should do. But what does
everyone think
Commissioner Bradford: But what he's asking for is 2 months abatement at $1.
Commissioner Cunningham: Despite my personal sympathies, which yeah, I assure everyone that personal
sympathy is not an issue, but I don't know if pain and suffering as part of our per view, but the overhead
expenses, and I think the liability of the landlord for the first place, my place. So, I'm inclined to grant 2 months
at a buck.
Commissioner Cunningham: so yeah, that's my motion.
Commissioner Robinson: And we have a second, correct? Yes.
Commissioner Robinson: all in favor.
Commissioners: Aye
Commissioner Robinson: So that concludes the cases.
Commissioner Coggins: Can we make sure that all of the orders? If it's not included language about retaliation?
I think we talked about that for one of them. But just to make sure that all of them have that.
Commissioner Cunningham: Yeah, we want to make sure it gets to William Pitt at the Superior court so that
they have that on file.
Commissioner Robinson: Salvatore are we including the language concerning retaliation in the orders.
Salvatore McClain: Yes, they'll go out going forward.
Commissioner Robinson: So, the next thing on the agenda is a submission of the submission of the forms. I
developed a form, I think, and Peter was supposed to develop one, too. I don't know if it's available today. But I
made a form. It's not pretty, but I just wanted to get a rough draft of one to you guys concerning enforcement to
see if you could see if you guys had any feedback on it. As to whether it's something that we could use.
Commissioner Robinson: What do you think about it? I don't know if everybody had an opportunity to review it.
Commissioner Bradford: I did briefly before the meeting. It looked good to me as well.
Commissioner Robinson: Okay. Salvatore can you just look and review it and tell me if that's something we
could implement? We could make it prettier and put some more lines in it or make it fillable online.
Salvatore McClain: Just a second about the form Commissioner Robertson you sent over and I’ll take a glance
at it.
Commissioner Robinson: I mean, we? We could make changes to it. I just wanted to know if that's a good
baseline to work with.
Salvatore McClain: Only thing I wondered about is if we need to include a place for us to indicate the date that
it's received, and in addition to the date that it's signed by the person making the complaint, and whether we
are including both noncompliance with orders and calling out retaliation specifically as well in this form, or if
that's being treated separately.
Commissioner Robinson: I thought we were going treat that stuff separately. I think he's correct me, If I'm
wrong, I could put that on the next agenda.
Commissioner Robinson: I mean, we could adjust this form to include retaliation.
Attorney Lee : I think it makes sense to combine the forms and put them both in the same form, because I think
there's going to be a lot of overlap, because I think tenants are probably going to claim that the landlords aren't
making the improvements that were ordered in retaliation for making a fair rent complaint.
Commissioner Robinson: alright. So, what I could do is that I can add a retaliation section and then, do you
guys, do you want? I mean we. We need to probably get it out as soon as possible. Do you want to approve it
at the next hearing.
Salvatore McClain: name as a form of noncompliance, just so that people using the form know that's something
that they can report as well as other forms of noncompliance.
Attorney Lee : So yes, I think that makes sense. So how about you do that? Why don't you approve the form
subject to the condition that a paragraph is added regarding or provisions added regarding retaliation. In that
way we can get it posted before your next meeting.
Commissioner Robinson: Okay, so I'll motion to approve the form subject to there being an additional
paragraph referencing retaliation by landlord against tenant.
Commissioner Bradford: A second a motion
Commissioner Robinson: All in favor.
Commissioners: Aye.
Commissioner Robinson: I was going to say I wanted to get a brief, just briefly go over the process for it with
while Salvatore was here? To see, would it be the same process as filing a complaint or would it be something
different?
Attorney Lee: Well, I we've had a couple of meetings in Town Hall regarding this issue, and I think there's some
additional meetings as to how enforcement is going to work, but I think the process would be the same as
somebody filing a complaint if they're going to allege noncompliance or retaliation. They complete the form.
They'd submit it to Salvatore at the community office. It would get docketed on the Commission's agenda. We
would have sent out notice to the landlord and notice to the tenant the Commission would have to conduct a
hearing, and the hearing would be limited to the issue as to whether there was compliance with the order.
Attorney Lee: After the hearing, the Commission then would decide what remedy, that if any, that they deemed
appropriate
Commissioner Robinson: Okay, that makes alright that that explains it.
Commissioner Cunningham: Post a copy of the form on the Fair Commission web page and folks could
download it or fill it out.
Commissioner Coggins: Given that, it's new and we've heard concerns and public comment about retaliation.
Can we sort of proactively send it out to anyone that we have? Anyone who's case? We have issued an order
for just to let them know that this is available.
Attorney Lee: I probably not the right person to answer that question, but maybe I don't know if,
administratively, if that would impose a burden on Salvatore to do that.
Salvatore McClain: as long as we add in the new paragraph, I'll make the time to do it.
Commissioner Robinson: Okay?
Commissioner Bradford: Yeah, because we do have several cases where the orders that we did pass that are
not being followed.
Attorney Lee: The Tenants Union will probably do a pretty good job of getting the word out, but we can.
Certainly, if Salvatore is willing to send letters out, we can do that as well.
Commissioner Robinson: okay, I'll add that in there a referee of retaliation.
Commissioner Cunningham: I did get in touch with the chief clerk of the State Housing Court, and he said that
any moving forward based on what he said, we should include him. Oh, his name is William Pitt. I think I
forwarded his email address via email earlier. So just include him on those decisions. And he will keep a file
with the judge so it's just on file with the court. He said, the you know the judge would be made aware of that as
well.
That was just the best way to do that moving forward. The way the system works. Anyone can pay their court
fee and initiate a corporation, even if it's bogus, even if it gets thrown out ultimately. It's still, you know, the
process is the process, and you have to have to go through the motion, so I don't want anyone to feel as
though they could ignore court orders because they think it's you know, our orders don't supersede court
proceedings based on. So that being made clear, I you know.
Commissioner Cunningham: Ultimately. When everything's heard, the court will have our decisions on file. So
that's what I was told by the chief clerk of the Housing court.
Commissioner Robinson: So, what we need to do is CC. The housing court.
Commissioner Cunningham: Okay. So, we have to CC, him on the on. Yeah. So when we when we send
decisions to the landlord and tenant, I think just CC.
Attorney Lee: So, he's going to be able to cross Re, I mean, do it if he's had to do it. But he's going to be up the
cross reference anytime. There's an eviction action he's going to go through in in in the kind of hand, and he's
going to go through the fair rent cases and try to line up and see if there's
Commissioner Cunningham: if a tenant. Maybe if a tenant raises an issue as an offense, they'll have it on files.
Yeah, I think it was more that if we issue a cease and desist against order to quit, and the tenant can. Their
lawyer can say you know. There, you know, there was an order on file, and they could say, Oh, yeah. So, there
was. Just so that that part makes sense. I think the tenants in the eviction action still going to have to raise the
issue that they think the point, he was saying was, you still have to go through legal channels. You can't just
ignore stuff because you feel it's unjust. You have to, you know. Continue to go through the law.
Commissioner Robinson: Well, I motion that that all Primary Commission orders be BCC to the Housing court
at the Superior Court.
Commissioner Cunningham: William Pitt, and I'll forward his email address around and I'll second that motion.
Commissioner Robinson: All right. All in favor.
Commissioners: Aye
Commissioner Robinson: So that way the court has knowledge of it. But I think that these tenants need to make
sure they have the order in hand if there's any action, and they need to make because things could get lost in
the shuffle. And they have to make the court aware that there's a Fair Rent Commission order.
Commissioner Bradford: I think it'd be good if we send it out, and they need to also forward it to Salvatore if
they get one, if they have a hearing, a pending hearing.
Commissioner Robinson: Well, that would be, I mean, wouldn't that be part of the retaliation part? The
retaliation form that they fill out
Commissioner Bradford: It could be, you know, but we need a copy of it. We, you know, it's just like we heard
tonight that you know there was a motion to quit, and we never got any copy of it.
Attorney Lee: But all notices to quit may not be retaliatory, so if you look at the ordinance, I even if there's a fair
rent decision that says that we reduce the rent to 2,000 from 2,200. If the tenant doesn't pay the rent, the
landlord still has a right to serve in those rent, seek an eviction action.
Commissioner Robinson: Alright. So, any other new business.
Commissioner Robinson: Alright schedule of additional hearings and cases. So, our next hearing would be
November 2 which for some reason, says Day of the dead on my calendar. I don't know why but November
second would be the here would be the next hearing. Do we have cases. Identified for November second?
Commissioner Cunningham: We're not. We're not scheduled. We're not going to schedule a meeting in
between. Correct?
Salvatore McClain: I was going to say for November second, we could hear case number 23 dash 0 0 2.
Kirsten Hanson case number 23, dash 0, 2, 4, Michael Moore.
Salvatore McClain: 22. Dash. Excuse me. 23. Dash. 0 2, 5. Rachel Vincent
Salvatore McClain: 23 dash 0 2. 6. Meet Rachel Berzinski.
Commissioner Robinson: That's 4 cases, that will give us 4 cases. Alright. So let me make sure. Case number
23, dash 0 0 2,
Commissioner Robinson: 23, dash 0, 0, 4, 23, dash 0, 2, 5 and 20,
Commissioner Robinson: 3, dash 0, 2, 6,
Commissioner Robinson: I'll motion that. Have case number cases number 22, 0 0 2,
Commissioner Robinson: 20. I'm sorry. 23. Dash 0, 0, 2, 23, dash 0, 0, 4, 23, dash 0, 2, 5 and 23, dash 0, 2, 6.
Commissioner Robinson: Alright. So, it'd be 23.0 2 4, they would be heard on November 2 at 6 pm. For the
next Fair Rank Commission, hearing a motion for those to be heard. Can I get a second
Commissioner Nedd: second, the motion.
Commissioner Robinson: all in favor?
Commissioners: Aye
Commissioner Robinson: Okay, those 4 cases will be heard on that that day. So, I think as far as the exhibits, I
think we need to make sure that they're sent to the other parties beforehand because these people want their
exhibits to get in, and I spent like a 15 min or more than 50 min trying to send trying to send these exhibits out
here, but they were too big to send. So, we just need to make sure they get it out for the hearing, so everybody
has them because it will save us some time. I'm not good with this email stuff. And I'm not sending these
attachments properly. Do we have anything else?
Commissioner Coggins: A quick question on what you just said? Would it be possible to put things in like a
Google drive or Dropbox or something.
Commissioner Robinson: You read my mind, Commissioner Coggins. I don't know if we can do that, because I
know how to do it on Google. But when I try to send links out because you could actually link on word. The
Hamden Town Hall works on word you a word you can actually send links out, but not everybody can get
access, so I could send a link out of the files in in a folder, but I don't think everybody who's not within the towns
system will be able to get access to it.
For instance, when I sent this form out as a as a link from my folder. Commissioner Cunningham wasn’t able to
get access either. Windows 360, and I wasn't sure I couldn't remember if I had a login or what it was, or what.
So right? So right, if you don't have access to it, I don't know. I don't know if we could do it on Google Drive.
And we're allowed to do that. I know I can do it on Google Drive. It'll be easy. I don't know if we're allowed to do
that, because of these type. Have the documentation hanging out on a Google drive or not. But I could check
with a the town. I'll look into it and see if it could be done. Cause that's a good idea. That's a great idea.
Commissioner Robinson: Alright. Is there anything else? Okay? So, this meeting is now adjourned until
November second, 2023.
Commissioner Robinson: Thank you for your time and patience. Appreciate it.
Commissioner Cunningham: Have a good night, everyone. Thank you.
